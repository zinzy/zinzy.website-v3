    description: "You're welcome to [skip the hello](https://nohello.net/en/) and instead just say what you want. Make sure to give me some context, and if your message is time-sensitive, lead with that (e.g. `[Contains time-sensitive request]`). I enjoy asynchronous communication, because it helps me manage my inboxes."
  - channel: "Video / voice / live"
    description: "I'm often available for a huddle, especially if it pertains to time-sensitive work keeping engineers busy. Are we both at the office? Pull me aside, let's grab coffee. I like connecting with coworkers!"
