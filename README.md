# zinzy.website

This is a personal website for Zinzy Waleson Geene running on Hugo. It's a supremely personal and in many cases flawed project not suitable for consumption. Here be dragons.

## Quick Start

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies, and develop with `npm run dev` (this triggers Hugo and Tailwind).
