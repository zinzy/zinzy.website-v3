    <h3>I'm a User Experience practitioner; a researcher and designer creating tools for people at work</h3>
    <p>For the past seventeen years, I've worked as a researcher, developer, designer, design manager, and product manager in technology companies across a variety of industries. I take a Ted Lasso approach to building products: I care little about my job title, and a lot about whatever activity will help us solve problems more effectively.</p>
