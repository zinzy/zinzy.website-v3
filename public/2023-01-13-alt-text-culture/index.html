        <p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code>alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I&rsquo;ve come to regard <code>alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>
<p>For me, <code>alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don&rsquo;t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s slowest tooltip&rdquo;. In addition, I&rsquo;ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code>alt</code> text into places where it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Places that don&rsquo;t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>&rsquo;s profile and banner images.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of &ldquo;young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer&rdquo;. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>
<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness ‚Äî her self-awareness about what the image could convey ‚Äî that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>
<p>What does it mean, I&rsquo;ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code>alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we&rsquo;ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I&rsquo;d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>
<p>Today, Piper Haywood&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/">put me onto a handy <code>alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I&rsquo;m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, &ldquo;Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?&rdquo;, is &ldquo;use an empty <code>alt</code>&rdquo; and not &ldquo;don&rsquo;t post the image&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>
