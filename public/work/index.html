<p>A provider of healthcare software. Rather than specialize in a particular business domain, I see the commonalities across these domains, and apply best practices accordingly.</p>
<p>I love business-to-business software because of its intricate business rules, serious problems, and domain experts. Healthcare technology is, by far, the most complex domain I&rsquo;ve worked in, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>
