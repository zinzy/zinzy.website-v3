  <a href="/about" class="">about</a> me.</p>
<h3 id="if-i-came-with-a-warning-label-it-would-say">If I came with a warning label, it would say</h3>
<p>If golden retriever energy and the Law of Two Feet had a love child that periodically throws glitter in your face.</p>
<h3 id="heres-what-i-do-at-work">Here&rsquo;s what I do at work</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a UX team-of-one operating alongside all scrum teams in our department. As the PO&rsquo;s sidekick, I do whatever is needed to ensure a smooth trajectory of product ideas, from discovery to production. My deliverables are feature design as well as broad-scope research projects that usually involves a lot of research, stakeholder management, and facilitation.</p>
<h3 id="my-availability">My availability</h3>
<p>I like an early start, so you can usually expect me to be at work anywhere between 07:30 and 18:00. I spend at least one full day at the office, as well as at least two mornings or afternoons. This way, I get to see as many people in person as possible. I enjoy a day off every other Monday.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-my-day">Structure of my day</h3>
<p>I prefer to not be engaged in daily standups unless I&rsquo;m actually a member of a scrum team. If I do need to check in with one or more people, I prefer to do so between 09:00 and 10:00. This gives me time for deep work in the morning. I prefer a fixed time for lunch every day because I helps me unwind, and don&rsquo;t take lunch meetings as a rule. My one-on-one meetings last 30 minutes, and I generally will do my best to get out of group meetings that last longer than one hour.</p>
<h3 id="i-do-my-very-best-work-when">I do my very best work when</h3>
<ul>
<li>I get to work in a multidisciplinary setting, building bridges between people and teams, and aligning closely with engineers</li>
<li>I have the autonomy to work at my own speed</li>
<li>I get to take ownership of solving problems I see or experience</li>
<li>I can help facilitate a smooth development process by carrying out data-driven design in the right amount, at the right time</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-prefer-communicating-in-these-ways">I prefer communicating in these ways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slack: if you want to catch up, 






  
  
  

<a href="https://nohello.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ↗'] ">skip the hello</a> and instead just say so. If you need something from me, I&rsquo;m happy to help. Make sure to give me some context of what you&rsquo;re looking for. If your message is time-sensitive, lead with that (e.g. &ldquo;Contains time-sensitive request&rdquo;). I enjoy asynchronous communication, because it helps me manage my inboxes</li>
<li>Figma: any questions or feedback regarding specific designs are the perfect reason to write a Figma comment. It helps us document properly, but more importantly, it keeps the conversation going in a place where we can all see it.</li>
<li>Video / Voice / Live: I&rsquo;m often available for a huddle, especially if it pertains to time-sensitive work keeping engineers busy. Are we both at the office? Pull me aside, let&rsquo;s grab coffee. I like connecting with coworkers!</li>
<li>Email: Here&rsquo;s a coming out moment, I detest email. If you need a paper trail, or if external people need to be involved, feel free to shoot me one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-receiving-feedback">When receiving feedback&hellip;</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are able to and comfortable, give it to me face-to-face. I use cues from your tone, face, posture, and demeanor to contextualize what you&rsquo;re saying. It may help for me to ask some clarifying questions, too.</li>
<li>The maxim <a href="/">Praise in public, criticize in private</a> is important to me, particularly the latter part. If you have feedback about something I handled poorly or should stop doing, I prefer we speak about it one-on-one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-motivates-me-to-come-into-work-each-day-is-">What motivates me to come into work each day is &hellip;</h3>
<ul>
<li>At heart, I&rsquo;m a problem solver. I love that I get to do this for a living</li>
<li>I have a strong mission-driven work ethic, and I feel most comfortable at companies that do something that seeks to fundamentally address the things that make working life challenging for essential workers</li>
<li>Having the ability to grow as a researcher and designer, as a coworker, and as a human</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-put-boundaries-in-place-between-work-and-home-in-the-following-ways-please-help-me-respect-them">I put boundaries in place between work and home in the following ways, please help me respect them…</h3>
<p>I diligently use the 🤫 emoji on Slack to let my coworkers know I&rsquo;m in focus mode. Other than that, when I&rsquo;m not on Slack, I&rsquo;m not at work. Please don&rsquo;t call me or text me about work matters outside of my working hours.</p>
<h3 id="when-im-stressed-the-best-way-to-support-me-is-">When I’m stressed, the best way to support me is …</h3>
<p>By asking me what I need. I struggle when people try to solve my problem, because it makes me feel I like autonomy, and I&rsquo;m unable to explain my perspective accurately.</p>
