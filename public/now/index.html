<h3 id="things-almost-seem-normal-again">Things almost seem normal again</h3>
<p>Every now and then, when the moment is just right, I forget that I can&rsquo;t really <em>walk</em> just yet. Like the morning of this photo, when I did my home-famous ballet jump, only to land on my left foot in a way that made me regret everything. It was the morning of my birthday gift to Anja: a taster class at 






  
  
  

<a href="https://www.studiopansa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">Studio Pansa</a>, where she hadn&rsquo;t been since her head injury. About three months ago, 






  
  
  


      
    
  <a href="/tags/broken-ankle/" class="">I triple-fractured my ankle</a>. What came after was a transformation, both of the body and of the mind.</p>
<h3 id="at-work">At work,</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s much to discover. We&rsquo;re full steam ahead, and there are plenty of unknowns to investigate, which means I&rsquo;ve got my hands in the clay of delicious exploratory research. I&rsquo;m impressed with how capable we all are of committing to continuous research. Meanwhile, Gerimedica is growing, and it&rsquo;s great to welcome new faces.</p>
<h3 id="health-wise">Health-wise,</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted by my progress. When I was on the ground behind the Royal Palace, tired head resting on the cobblestones, getting acquainted with the sensation of fracture, one thought hovered in my head: I&rsquo;ll wake up in April thinking &ldquo;oh wow, I can barely remember what that felt like.&rdquo; Nothing could be further from the truth. Every day, I have at least half a dozen d√©j√† vus.</p>
<p>Remember when bathroom visits were pistol squats? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk into the patio at home? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk to the tram stop? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk and hold anything but crutches? Remember how your left leg was elevated two feet at bedtime, 7 weeks in a row? Physical therapy thrice weekly is doing wonders.</p>
<h3 id="at-home">At home,</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking on DIY projects again. Now that I&rsquo;m better able to help out around the house, Anja gets a much-needed break from it all. Also: home improvement! We recently began remodeling our bathroom, and boy, does it look sexy. I feel like I live in a Swedish hotel.</p>
<h3 id="community-wise">Community-wise,</h3>
<p>All Saints continues to grow. While we&rsquo;re still a small bunch, familiar faces keep returning to join a church service, to attend morning or evening prayer. Recently, we hosted a Bible study at the most progressive queer bar in town. Shouting thoughtfulness across the table over loud music, and sitting with our eyes closed praying for each other felt so powerful. I love the community we&rsquo;re perpetually becoming.</p>
<h3 id="what-im-looking-forward-to">What I&rsquo;m looking forward to</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m impatient to get back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, foot-wise, because I have things to do! We&rsquo;re hoping to make it to Paris in late April, and in the meantime, my excitement for pottery continues to simmer. I&rsquo;m looking to enroll in an eight-week ceramics course to better understand the process, and to get that coveted status of being eligible to become a studio member at Pansa.</p>

<p>Here I am with Anja outside Badeta, a local coffee place. We visited het dad in de Bijlmer this morning, and just finished biking back to Indische Buurt. I love riding my bike with her. This is one of our micro dates: a little pocket of quiet time for coffee or ice cream. It&rsquo;s a good day.</p>
<h3 id="work-is-slow-but-sweet">Work is slow but sweet</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming out of a slow period at work: projects wrapping up, establishing new objectives, reporting back on research. I&rsquo;m excited about something new, something to sink my teeth into. Something difficult, intricate, substantive.</p>
<p>In the meantime there is the never-boring project of being the best coworker I can be. In the past few months, I&rsquo;ve had one or two headaches about that, but I feel I&rsquo;m making progress.</p>

<p>I am stoked that I&rsquo;ve successfully established a workout routine. Personal health challenges make it notoriously difficult for me to work out in a way that&rsquo;s healthy and sustainable, and after five months of taking it more slowly than I ever nightmared I could, I find myself embracing early morning workouts that really set the tone for the rest of the day. #Proud.</p>

        <content class=""> <p>Here I am at Coffee Company Oosterdok, pondering what I&rsquo;ll have for lunch. I&rsquo;m enjoying my winter break, which I spend at museums, the library, cafes, the park. A lot of walking is involved.

<h3 id="existing">Existing</h3>
<p>In Amsterdam&rsquo;s finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I&rsquo;m watching a very wet Winter drift by, and not hating it. Anja just sprinted towards her own winter break, and I&rsquo;ve taken some time off between my birthday and New Year&rsquo;s. The house is decorated for Chanukkah and Christmas, and we turn the heating on most days. The plans we do make are about upcycling the table we found by the trash pick-up point, sewing clothes and head wraps, geeking out with our digital iPad planners in our pajamas. Lemonade made it through her first heat just fine, and got a great report card from the vet for her annual check-up, both physically and behaviorally.</p>
<h3 id="enjoying">Enjoying</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making a serious effort to be Black, which is to say: to see with my own eyes who my peoples are, to learn about cuisines in the African diaspora, to feel comfortable wearing head wraps, to offset the overwhelming underrepresentation of myself in my daily life not with narratives of white people failing (on Dr Phil, TikTok, and Reddit), but of Black people succeeding. On an adjacent note, I just got the memo on audiobooks. I don&rsquo;t always have an easy time paying attention to spoken words, but I&rsquo;m on the bandwagon now and rapidly approaching reaching my reading goal of 2023.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>I feel fortunate to be engaged in a number of communities where I meet people in which I can see myself. A few months ago, I discovered Bar Bario, a place by and for queer people of color. In addition, I&rsquo;m enjoying watching the community grow at All Saints Amsterdam, where I&rsquo;ve joined the board as warden, which is to say I maintain the group&rsquo;s digital endeavors. In the margins of my thoughts, I&rsquo;m slowly putting together what the future of Queer Salon will be.</p>
<h3 id="working">Working</h3>
<p>I just celebrated six months at healthcare technology scaleup Gerimedica, where I&rsquo;m a senior-but-silly researcher and designer. The term <em>senior-but-silly</em> is growing on me, because it helps me be humbly confident, and open to the whimsy&rsquo;s of working with other people for a common good. I&rsquo;m impressed by the company Gerimedica has become, and I am even more excited about their current challenges than I was when I began. Some questions I ask myself as part of my daily work are: how can designers facilitate developers? How do I foster user-centered curiosity among domain experts? How can we work on our design system without taking time away from the roadmap items?</p>
