<p>Every now and then, when the moment is just right, I forget that I can&rsquo;t really <em>walk</em> just yet. Like the morning of this photo, when I did my home-famous ballet jump, only to land on my left foot in a way that made me regret everything. It was the morning of my birthday gift to Anja: a taster class at

  <a href="/tags/broken-ankle/" class="">I triple-fractured my ankle</a>. What came after was a transformation, both of the body and of the mind.</p>
<h3 id="at-work">At work,</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s much to discover. We&rsquo;re full steam ahead, and there are plenty of unknowns to investigate, which means I&rsquo;ve got my hands in the clay of delicious exploratory research. I&rsquo;m impressed with how capable we all are of committing to continuous research. Meanwhile, Gerimedica is growing, and it&rsquo;s great to welcome new faces.</p>
<h3 id="health-wise">Health-wise,</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted by my progress. When I was on the ground behind the Royal Palace, tired head resting on the cobblestones, getting acquainted with the sensation of fracture, one thought hovered in my head: I&rsquo;ll wake up in April thinking &ldquo;oh wow, I can barely remember what that felt like.&rdquo; Nothing could be further from the truth. Every day, I have at least half a dozen d√©j√† vus.</p>
<p>Remember when bathroom visits were pistol squats? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk into the patio at home? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk to the tram stop? Remember when you couldn&rsquo;t walk and hold anything but crutches? Remember how your left leg was elevated two feet at bedtime, 7 weeks in a row? Physical therapy thrice weekly is doing wonders.</p>
<h3 id="at-home">At home,</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking on DIY projects again. Now that I&rsquo;m better able to help out around the house, Anja gets a much-needed break from it all. Also: home improvement! We recently began remodeling our bathroom, and boy, does it look sexy. I feel like I live in a Swedish hotel.</p>
<h3 id="community-wise">Community-wise,</h3>
<p>All Saints continues to grow. While we&rsquo;re still a small bunch, familiar faces keep returning to join a church service, to attend morning or evening prayer. Recently, we hosted a Bible study at the most progressive queer bar in town. Shouting thoughtfulness across the table over loud music, and sitting with our eyes closed praying for each other felt so powerful. I love the community we&rsquo;re perpetually becoming.</p>
<h3 id="what-im-looking-forward-to">What I&rsquo;m looking forward to</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m impatient to get back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, foot-wise, because I have things to do! We&rsquo;re hoping to make it to Paris in late April, and in the meantime, my excitement for pottery continues to simmer. I&rsquo;m looking to enroll in an eight-week ceramics course to better understand the process, and to get that coveted status of being eligible to become a studio member at Pansa.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming out of a slow period at work: projects wrapping up, establishing new objectives, reporting back on research. I&rsquo;m excited about something new, something to sink my teeth into. Something difficult, intricate, substantive.</p>
<p>In the meantime there is the never-boring project of being the best coworker I can be. In the past few months, I&rsquo;ve had one or two headaches about that, but I feel I&rsquo;m making progress.</p>

        <content class=""> <h3 id="existing">Existing</h3>
<p>In Amsterdam&rsquo;s finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I&rsquo;m watching the autumn set in, and I&rsquo;m loving every minute of it. Apart from the scorching hot first week of September, everything about the weather tells me it&rsquo;s time for <em>hygge, hygge, hygge</em>. Anja&rsquo;s back in school, which means I&rsquo;m settling back into a more structured hybrid work method. Wednesdays I spend at the office, and the other days I start off at home, and join my coworkers on-site on most afternoons. I love this, and the structure of it all is doing me good.</p>
<h3 id="enjoying">Enjoying</h3>
<p>Unlike what I had planned, I barely spent any time in the pool this summer. What I did continue to develop is my yin yoga practice, alongside a practice of guided and unguided meditation. To decompress in the mornings and evenings, piano practice remains a close friend. I&rsquo;m not making the progress I want to be making, but composition and singing help me regulate emotions stunningly well. Lastly, I&rsquo;m fond of the writing practice I&rsquo;ve established. I publish on this website, write in my diary, and correspond via snail mail with a few friends.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>I feel fortunate to be engaged in a number of communities where I meet people in which I can see myself. A few months ago, I discovered Bar Bario, a place by and for queer people of color. In addition, I&rsquo;m enjoying watching the community grow at All Saints Amsterdam, where I&rsquo;ve joined the team as website person. In the margins of my thoughts, I&rsquo;m slowly putting together what the future of [[Queer Salon]] will be.</p>
<h3 id="working">Working</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m approaching 6 months at Gerimedica, where I&rsquo;m a senior-but-silly researcher and designer. The term <em>senior-but-silly</em> is growing on me, because it helps me be humbly confident, and open to the whimsy&rsquo;s of working with other people for a common good. I&rsquo;m impressed by the company Gerimedica has become, and I am even more excited about their current challenges than I was when I began. Some questions I ask myself as part of my daily work are: how can designers facilitate developers? How do I foster user-centered curiosity among domain experts? How do we organize a UX research repository in a strict GDPR environment?</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>Through trial and error, I continue to find ways to be my best self, both at home and at work. Acknowledging the physical and mental realities of my life, I&rsquo;ve been learning a lot about [[Neurodivergence in the workplace]], about the Polyvagal theory, and about a holistic, trauma-informed understanding of mental health.

It&rsquo;s a journey of rediscovering how I best learn, of what draws my attention, and of how music is the best mental health item in my toolbox. For entirely archival reasons, I&rsquo;m making a little EP with self-written songs this Summer.</p>
<p>Aside from music, I like to spend time writing, drawing, visiting the theatre, and swimming. With the puppy it&rsquo;s a bit of an adventure, but I&rsquo;m hoping to settle back into my 6:30AM morning swim routine. I&rsquo;ve missed swimming plenty over the winter, and it might be smart to find a good indoor pool for the later months of 2023. For now, I&rsquo;m pleased to know that Amsterdam&rsquo;s finest outdoor pool is in our own backyard.</p>

        <content class=""> <p>It&rsquo;s odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. We&rsquo;ve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>
<p>At Leeruniek, I&rsquo;m focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. It&rsquo;s great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We&rsquo;re also hiring in the product team and we&rsquo;ve already found a new engineer and a new designer. I&rsquo;m looking forward to exploring our new team setup.</p>
