&lt;p&gt;Daddy Cross, my friend and coworker with the best nickname in the world, is usually a very bold woman. The kind of power house I imagine Julia Louis-Dreyfus to be. Speaks truth to power in a voice that can do all sorts of things. Best physical comedy I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in a person. But I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised, because she&amp;rsquo;s a total theater kid. Last week, as I hobbled my way past her desk, she asked, in a squeaky voice: &amp;ldquo;Are you busy, like, in general?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m never busy. I learned early on in University that answering the question &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;Oh my, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; busy&amp;rdquo; was both boring and unproductive. I always reserve space for emergency design work, on-the-fly meetings, and time-sensitive requests. But Daddy Cross&amp;rsquo; question wasn&amp;rsquo;t about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rotterdamenglishspeakingtheatre.nl/tickets.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;In April, she and her theater friends will be on stage in Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt; (and hopefully Amsterdam) to perform an anthology of three single-act plays. Did I have a moment to maybe help them put together some promotional artwork?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2025/01/03/painting-fjords/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;I spent a week in the hospital becoming enthralled with the workings of Procreate.app&lt;/a&gt;. Where I&amp;rsquo;ve dreaded such assignments in the past simply because of how disappointing I find the work I produce in Adobe Illustrator, I now felt excitement about making something beautiful. And I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with how it all came together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the prominent memories I have of doing client work out of Studio Zinzy was the utter boredom I felt just &lt;em&gt;doing whatever they told me&lt;/em&gt;. My time on-site at technology companies gave me a sense of autonomy and proactiveness that I carry with me to this day. But with small-scale client work, after twenty times of a freelance writer telling me they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; preferred a serif font for a heading typeface because it looked softer, I usually just ended up giving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had expected doing this assignment would give me a similar lack of affect, but nothing could be further from the truth. Having been away from freelance work for a decade now, it seems I&amp;rsquo;ve made a transformation in the process. I suppose &amp;ldquo;the older you get, the fewer fucks you give&amp;rdquo; is an adage as true here as it is anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were various suggestions Daddy Cross made over WhatsApp that I second-guessed, didn&amp;rsquo;t like, or quietly ignored. Not because she&amp;rsquo;s an idiot, quite the contrary, but because I felt entirely comfortable thinking: I&amp;rsquo;m a designer, I know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. I&amp;rsquo;d take her considerations seriously, listen intently, and return something that surprised her. Kinda like ChatGPT, but without the hallucinations and poor visual execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doodling hands and phone cords for a week I realized: thirteen years ago, I was giving in because my design practice was immature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the result speaks for itself: delightful film noir-inspired scenes with a moody color scheme and lots of ink wash. And what a blast it was creating it. Daddy Cross already asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d be available for more assignments. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in the area early April,

            Our uncle, Larry David

        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:24:23 -2100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2025/02/21/our-uncle-larry-david/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the sweeter developments of 2025 so far has been our commitment to watch all of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;. Expecting the dull inner laugh unnoticeable to any bystander that I produce under &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m struck by its brilliant writing, hilarious approach to nihilism, and the string of supporting characters who went on to become stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;, however, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where it is today in our home (halfway through season five) if we hadn&amp;rsquo;t first watched &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;, the mockumentary about &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; creator Larry David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon viewing those first few &lt;em&gt;Curb&lt;/em&gt; episodes, my gut instinct was to complain about how unrealistic Larry David is. Here is a man with a complete lack of decorum, an annoyingly pedantic approach to society&amp;rsquo;s unwritten rules, an inexplicable penchant for arguments, and a perplexing ability to successfully lay on the charm when the time is right, with women well above his pay grade, no less. Nobody is &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; that, I kept screaming at the wall on which we project our streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while of me getting used to his shenanigans, though, Larry David really began to grow on me. I love Larry David. He should&amp;rsquo;ve been the author of that book on how not giving a fuck is a subtle art, albeit not so subtle when he does it. I began to understand I had known Larry David all along. My father-in-law is Larry David. And I think that one coworker is headed there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I miss the show if I don&amp;rsquo;t see it for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there ever were an objectively correct order in which to watch two television series, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;first &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine laughing out loud as much as I do watching them had I seen them any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that unsatisfying horror movie &lt;em&gt;Identity&lt;/em&gt;? A whodunit of serial killing against the backdrop of a &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt; decor that turns out to be the inner world of a psychopath with multiple identity disorder? Well into my fifth season of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve become a firm believer in that Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are fragments of Larry David. Mostly George, but all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m not doing Jerry Seinfeld himself any justice, but 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/jerry-seinfeld-palestine-israel-gaza-snl-50-b2699884.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care&lt;/a&gt;. I also know I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring four years of what comparative literary studies taught me about the difference between the author and their character. I see Larry David&amp;rsquo;s character in &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;
everywhere I look. I simply can&amp;rsquo;t see anything else. I try, but I fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every episode of &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt; introduces some variant on Chekhov&amp;rsquo;s gun, and as a viewer I spend the rest of the 25 minutes debating Anja on how it will end up making Larry David look like an asshole. It&amp;rsquo;s really not much different with &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;, except the question is &amp;ldquo;how will Elaine break up with the guy?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how will George find a way to ruin that good thing that just happened despite the horror show of a man he is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; has become like hanging around at your aunt&amp;rsquo;s place after Christmas dinner, huddled around the warm light of the television showing 1955&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Sissi&lt;/em&gt; on mute, exchanging looks of understanding with your cousin as you listen to the crazy stories your uncle won&amp;rsquo;t stop telling. &amp;ldquo;Ah, uncle Larry David&amp;rdquo;, we mumble to each other, a faint smile on our face before we spit out our drink laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Black boy on the tram: &amp;ldquo;So, why are you into Trump?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black girl: &amp;ldquo;He is a sugar daddy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to be: glad that this girl doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Trump would never take a Black woman as his sugar baby, or sad that this girl doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Trump would never take a Black woman as his sugar baby.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 7: bathroom
          
        </title>

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2025-02-16_01.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;...&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sometimes, IKEA really knows how to put together a vibe. I love our remodelled bathroom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-wins&#34;&gt;Three wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished the first stage of our bathroom remodel. While Anja, did the vast majority of the work, we managed to collaborate well on putting together the medicine cabinet. I quickly lost the ability to understand anyone who does not have storage space behind their mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I walked from the office to a favorite coffee spot with coworker C., mostly without crutches! It was a win, endurance-wise, but a failure in self control. I spent the rest of the week feeling the ramifications of this adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anja and I took an amazing pottery workshop at Pansa. She has been a member there for years, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t been since her head injury in April. I was hoping this beginner&amp;rsquo;s workshop would give her back her confidence, and I seem to have succeeded. Of course, I, too, will be signing up for their full workshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/now_2025-02-21.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;...&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;As part of her birthday, I took Anja to a ceramics class&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stuff-i-did&#34;&gt;Stuff I did&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was amazing: very few feature design balls to juggle, and ample time to work on discovery and research projects. I got great feedback from a coworker about a research project I recently wrapped up, and was invited to share about it more broadly. It aligns well with one of my professional goals of 2025: to standardize research efforts across our entire product development department. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my coworkers who&amp;rsquo;s in amateur theater asked me to design the poster for the their next play. I got to doodling right away, and a week later, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a beautiful draft that I&amp;rsquo;ll be fleshing into something more substantial in Procreate. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to work on my iPad to create something like this. I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to share it once it&amp;rsquo;s done. (2025-02-21 update:

&lt;h3 id=&#34;consumed&#34;&gt;Consumed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve begun watching &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I love, but which does amuse me with its untypical protagonist. Much like the week before I went back to the hospital a second time, I am still watching that 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2025/01/12/week-2-pruning/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;horribly brilliant Dutch show about K-list levenslied singers&lt;/a&gt;. At this point it has been two months, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even embarrassed anymore. I feel like a discoverer on a mission in my psyche, looking to uncovere why in the godforsaken world anyone would binge watch a three-season reality show on single repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purchased&#34;&gt;Purchased&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two coworkers and I had our first of what I hope to many editions of the Finer Things Club. Our inaugural dinner was at Hoi Tin, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town. I tipped royally and paid €150. Pretty cheap for a mountain of dim sum, soup, and sizzling deliciousness! I bought the most appropriate Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day card I could&amp;rsquo;ve ever found: €4,40. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m getting around more, my public transport spending is on the rise. An acceptable €30,24 this week, but I wonder when enough will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovered&#34;&gt;Discovered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NTS Radio continues to be a great way to discover new music. Tennishu&amp;rsquo;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;appreciated&#34;&gt;Appreciated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three weeks of February are always busy: our anniversary, Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, and Anja&amp;rsquo;s birthday are ample reasons to celebrate, but I usually struggle to find the right balance without overloading Anja with gifts that are cute in the moment, but that don&amp;rsquo;t really leave a lasting impression. What &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been leaving a lasting impression is how well we communicate, and how we work together to make our home a sanctuary. This week, she worked tirelessly on the bathroom, and it is so beautiful I now want to take ten showers a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondered&#34;&gt;Wondered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I make bathroom grout white-white afgain? How many days are there between February 15 and March 18? How was Staples founded? What&amp;rsquo;s the 30-Day Cycle in the Episcopal tradition? What&amp;rsquo;s a good recipe for creamy mushroom dal? How about for jollof? How&amp;rsquo;s Justin Hall doing? How much is a ceramics wheel? What does a lotus look like? What&amp;rsquo;s the name of that show about the boy who has a friend whose parents are poor migrant workers and live in a semi-basement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;something-to-improve&#34;&gt;Something to improve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, with all its beautiful encounters, fun work projects, and gorgeous bathroom developments, was a bit of a chaotic one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take enough time to do my physical therapy exercises at home, or take enough rest in general. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to doing better in that regard next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I dreamed I added my profile picture to an IndieWeb directory. Upon visiting the website in question, I noticed how my initial difficulty to correctly operate my phone&amp;rsquo;s photo library had resulted in two pictures. The first one showed my face, and the second did, too. Scrolling down, though, any viewer would immediately be met with my bare chest. I panicked, and thought about people who fall victim to revenge porn. &amp;ldquo;Would my pictures be eligible for removal&amp;rdquo;, I wondered, &amp;ldquo;even if I was the one who committed the act?&amp;rdquo; I spent the rest of the saga stressed and horrified. Moments later, I wake up to Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, fully clothed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to describe how loud the birds are against the dark dark blue sky across the street from the hospital, and even more difficult to convey the dread I feel as I hear their poop splatter on the floor, but it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to say what it means to walk on two feet again, even if it&amp;rsquo;s with crutches and the occasional pain: the attitude is gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mother on the tram to the two-year-old producing nails-on-a-chalkboard sounds with the mouth: &amp;ldquo;No honey, we can&amp;rsquo;t play with the clay now because it&amp;rsquo;s very cold. See, clay is made from bees wax. We&amp;rsquo;re almost home, but before that we need to go pick up feta at the supermarket.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to forgetful manoeuvring on my part, I find myself off work for the next three Fridays. Having spent two lovely days at the office this week, I can tell that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;m happy, but tired. Thankful, but tired. Challenged, but tired. Today&amp;rsquo;s the day I&amp;rsquo;ll finally tidy up all the medical supplies that have been scattered around the house since late October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterile gauze, pain killers, an ear thermometer, a dozen boxes of antibiotics, cotton pads, hospital documents, paper bags serving as portable trash bins, and adhesive bandages bandages bandages. One recurring thought has been that I&amp;rsquo;m so privileged to even be in the position to buy the number of island dressings that I did. That and all the cab rides to the hospital. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get one thing straight,&amp;rdquo; said the surgeon on Monday, &amp;ldquo;you and those bandages are done. Go home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all feels like another paragraph into a new chapter I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;On the Up and Up&amp;rdquo;. Wounds become scars, standing showers become normal, takeout deliveries become an exception, wheelchairs become dispensable, supplies become clutter, hearts become calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first time traveling to the office without taxi assistance since my accident. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see everyone, and nervous about how tight these hiking shoes feel. I&amp;rsquo;ve worn the right one plenty of times, but I&amp;rsquo;m breaking in the left one only now. I keep thinking &amp;ldquo;what if my leg explodes?!&amp;rdquo; but then I remember what the surgeon said during yesterday&amp;rsquo;s check-up: &amp;ldquo;you no longer have an ankle problem, only a head problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 2: Pruning

         alt=&#34;A bright pink rose among flowers sits in the sunlight&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Flores boys flowers are still going strong&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-wins&#34;&gt;Three wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the eleven peer reviews I had received at work, and was stunned, inspired, and humbled by the kindness and positivity. Part of me thinks that&amp;rsquo;s just because people felt sorry for me and my Christmas Eve surgery. A more positive part  sees I&amp;rsquo;m doing things right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite what I was told, my PICC line, which delivered antibiotics intravenously, was able to come out on Wednesday. This meant I no longer have to carry the dispenser pack, that I can pick up the dog again, and that I can take normal showers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had my first physical therapy session, where the therapists straightened me out right quick about my posture. The younger one, a senior student, massaged my calf in a way that gave me &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more flexibility it left me speechless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2025-01-08.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hands of a nurse handle medical equipment&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Removing a PICC line is as easy as taking a breath. The technical nurse was a great help. I still find it hard to believe that this purple tube was smaller than my blood vessel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stuff-i-did&#34;&gt;Stuff I did&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning from holiday in the middle of the work week is always a delight, as was confirmed by two relaxed days of catching up. I came back online after 26 days of alternating leisure and hospitalization. To my surprise, I was able to work the full day without requiring a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been making attempts to walk more, both around the house and in the neighborhood. It&amp;rsquo;s making me feel stronger, but also nervous. A small part of me thinks the infection in my foot is getting out of hand again, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll spend 2025 learning to walk on a prosthetic foot. To combat this anxiety, I spent a lot of time pruning my notes archive, which I currently manage with Obsidian, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on YouTube a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consumed&#34;&gt;Consumed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in between shows we can&amp;rsquo;t help but binge, Anja and I spent our evenings vegging out to &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;. During the day, when it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to wean myself off of the comfort of ad-free video streaming, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in the YouTube algorithm of clips and full episodes of

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovered&#34;&gt;Discovered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with music discovery is slowly beginning to change. I have a sneaking, though mostly unconfirmed, suspicion that my relationship with Spotify is not benefitting my favorite artists much. More annoyingly, I find that my listening habits have changed for the worse. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to stop listening to Spotify-generated playlists, and instead use user-generated playlists as mixtapes to discover new work. My biggest discovered this week was that

I&amp;rsquo;m trying it on for size, and low-key remembering where I left my iPod Classic.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s still cold and wet in Amsterdam, but sitting in the afternoon sun with Lemonade was a treat. My rigorous antibiotics protocol make me cherish my late morning coffees even more. Anja has developed an interest in bike repair, and it was adorable and lovely to see her on the patio in the cold, tinkering away. Our neighbors A&amp;amp;M invited us for pizza and the third installment of &lt;em&gt;O.J.: Made in America&lt;/em&gt;. Top 10 of the best pizzas I&amp;rsquo;ve had in my life. Could&amp;rsquo;ve had a break on all the n-words though, but I&amp;rsquo;m a part of it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondered&#34;&gt;Wondered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other Fleetwood Mac songs are there that heavily feature Stevie Nicks (very few)? How&amp;rsquo;s Sheryl Crow doing? What happened during the December murders? What&amp;rsquo;s the history of Mar-a-Lago? Why is it called Pale of Settlement? Is Zappa really Frank&amp;rsquo;s last name? What&amp;rsquo;s it called again, reptilian brain? Who&amp;rsquo;s behind that song &amp;ldquo;Children of the Night&amp;rdquo;? What&amp;rsquo;s the sternum? Where did Eurodance originate? Who calls their kid Sistine Stallone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;something-to-improve&#34;&gt;Something to improve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having YouTube as my life&amp;rsquo;s audiovisual backdrop is usually a sign that there are feelings I have trouble processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charging indicator light of my antibiotics dispenser pack was quite bright, all things considered. The technical nurse pulled out two feet of IV that led right to my heart and I felt nothing. Tonight marks the first night in two weeks that I get to twist and turn as much as I want in my sleep. Another milestone in a long trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2024/09/14/16/00/17/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;beautiful nonetheless&lt;/a&gt;, I spent a week with family and myself. Slightly bored during the day because of the temperatures, I took myself on a sunset cruise along the coastline. Farther out into the water, with the engines and silly party boat music off, the quietude of the ocean was breath-taking. Alive I felt looking at a dolphin up close without wanting to take a photograph of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my eating disorder recovery finding my way back to the gym has been on my bucket list for a while now. Frankly, I had never been able to develop a sustainable, healthy way of working out without relapsing into restrictive and unhealthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to reach a new level of recovery. Training (my emotional stamina) since Easter, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to develop an energizing, mindful practice that has made me so much stronger and confident. Getting back to the gym is in my top three of things I&amp;rsquo;m excited to do

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, M., the technical nurse who administered my first cassette of portable antibiotics. When Anja and I came home distraught and stressed after a chaotic discharge from the hospital, you saw what we needed, which was a friendly face and someone who made us feel at ease about a disquieting new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I learned today that my last dose of intravenous antibiotics ends tomorrow and not January 17, I was disappointed that I won&amp;rsquo;t get to see you again.&lt;/p&gt;

A song that, upon listening to it for the first time, became an immediate favorite.

&lt;p&gt;As I settle back in at home, I&amp;rsquo;m slowly shaking off the fear of germs that enveloped me at the hospital. It means getting to pet Lemonade again, who cuddles her way into my heart more deeply every day. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see what it does to me, our wordless relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Anja and I planned another Paris trip to use my unused train tickets, we got into a little argument about whether or not to take the dog. Anja says this is what we signed up for. I say a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; vacation is when I don&amp;rsquo;t have three walks around which to plan my days. But then again, with a face like this, will I ever need a vacation?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I took one of the last opportunities I had and changed the date of my inbound train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam, scheduled to leave tomorrow. This ticket was part of the original plan in which Anja, Lemonade, and I would go to Paris for three weeks to housesit for our cousin Anto. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to visit Paris again in May, but since I had already modified the outbound trip, Eurostar would only let me make further adjustments on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, the queue for Dutch customer service was so long that I was offered a shortcut to the English department. And what a delight it was indeed! James from Eurostar helped me rescheduled two tickets without any trouble whatsoever, in the span of only a few minutes, and at no additional charge. The whole thing made me wonder why I ever log onto the Internet to do anything by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my one conversation with James, I now have a new theory that I&amp;rsquo;m eager to put to the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easier it is to complete a task in private on a website, the friendlier customer service phone operators will be in completing it for me&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 1: hibernating
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2025/01/04/week-1-hibernating/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 07:49:01 -0400</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2025/01/04/week-1-hibernating/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it home after seven nights at the hospital! Staying there between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s really wasn&amp;rsquo;t as horrible as you&amp;rsquo;d imagine. I figured: if anything happens, I&amp;rsquo;m already at the hospital, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I should confess that I was excited to be released from the presence of my hospital neighbor, a dentureless elderly woman with 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2025/01/06/08/19/46/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;severe bowel problems&lt;/a&gt; whose sounds were revolting. If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how petty I am for focusing on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; instead of my own fracture-related infection, imagine what Anja&amp;rsquo;s life is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around post-surgery, my wounds are healing beautifully, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been gaining the confidence to put pressure on my feet again. A sweet development was putting on an actual pair of shoes for the first time since late October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedridden during my hospital stay, I discovered a new hobby: 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2025/01/03/painting-fjords/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;drawing on my iPad&lt;/a&gt;. Every time I google &amp;ldquo;Procreate&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m overwhelmed with my perceived lack of talent. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a new trick, though: don&amp;rsquo;t draw what other people have drawn. Pick a photograph and draw that, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, things quickly settled into a sweet rhythm: sleeping in until 7:30 A.M., Anja and I hang around the house, playing around with our digital planners, &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;, the technical nurse comes every day at noon to renew my antibiotics pack. Simple dinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel grateful for the Dutch healthcare system. I know, both personally and professionally, that there&amp;rsquo;s much to be improved. Still, this very specific scenario in which I find myself has me work with deeply concerned doctors, attentive nurses, and the luxury of having someone check on me every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good first week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally fallen in love with drawing on my iPad. During my stay at the hospital, I had so little to do that I eventually began doodling, exploring brushes, and mixing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how easy it is to learn how colors work, at least on a digital canvas. Below is an overview of four images of fjords I made. It&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to get the colors right when I&amp;rsquo;m working with a photograph, I&amp;rsquo;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2024-12-28_fjord-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 28 — I made this from memory, thinking back to our 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/08/17/norway-et-al/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;2023 summer in Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Colors are harsh, and the whole thing looks like I&amp;rsquo;m trying to hard to get into art school without knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2024-12-29_fjord-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 29 — &amp;ldquo;I think I should start with a beige canvas instead of a white one&amp;rdquo;, I thought here. Slightly better, but still not anything I&amp;rsquo;d put on the Internet with pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2024-12-30_fjord-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 30 — &amp;ldquo;Maybe the streaks don&amp;rsquo;t all need to be at a perfect 90 degrees?&amp;rdquo; I figured. The mountains in the back make me think of a Scientology leaflet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zinzy.website/img/photos/2024-12-30_fjord-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 30 — I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of this. I love the soft colors, and I believe the snow on the farthest mountain could be mistaken for that in a photograph, if one were to be looking at it with eyes half closed, for only half a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with everything I do only once, half-baked, without much effort, I&amp;rsquo;ve now declared myself a professional artist.&lt;/p&gt;

My original recovery timeline, which included surgery under general anesthesia, had me use first a cast and then an air cast until December 25. Tomorrow. But we make plans, and God laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few hours, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going in for a second surgery, this time to take care of the post-operative bacterial infection that&amp;rsquo;s been festering. After that, I&amp;rsquo;ll require twelve weeks of antibiotics, two of which intravenous. I expect that by this time next week, a nurse will visit my home daily to fix me up with a fresh bag of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I believe: we make plans, and God laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my head, God&amp;rsquo;s laugh doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound evil at all. It&amp;rsquo;s something like

The part about the &amp;ldquo;pure useful idiots&amp;rdquo; rang true for me; how did the relationship between fascism and antisemitism shift so drastically? Luckily we agree: it&amp;rsquo;s the people who make it worth the fight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been on my mind for a few days now is: if Adam didn&amp;rsquo;t know the difference between good and evil, why was dying bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;8 hours on both Thursday and Friday confirmed what I had hoped: I finally feel energetic and proactive enough to get back to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organized my workload to get reacquainted: what was I doing? Why do I care about this company? Why do I care about my coworkers? A nice

&lt;li&gt;Finished writing my letter to Mathilde, which had been a long time coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordered a muzzle and foldable travel crate for Lemonade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordered the New Zealand Prayer Book.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Doing my best to get in four Bible chapters a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started reading a chapter a day of &lt;em&gt;Live with Intentionality&lt;/em&gt; as part of my morning routine. Feel weird about the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s self-published by someone unknown to the Internet. It&amp;rsquo;s a helpful, concise read, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to exchange reading the news for reading IndieWeb RSS feeds in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we approach the end of 2024 (wow, already?!) I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to do something I have been anticipating for months: host the December 2024 edition of the IndieWeb Carnival (

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-theme-is-belief&#34;&gt;The theme is belief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an open theme, one that I hope will inspire you to share whatever pops into your head when you think about it. A few prompts to merely inspire you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What is something you can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;, but that you believe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s something you wish you could &lt;em&gt;unbelieve&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you relate to the word &amp;ldquo;belief&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guidelines&#34;&gt;Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit in English or any language open to online translation tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit in any medium as long as it produces a single URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send it to me on or before December 31, 2024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the email address zinzy {at} pm {.} me and the subject &amp;ldquo;IndieWeb Carnival on Belief&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I need some time to digest this theme myself. &lt;del&gt;A link to my post will appear on this page. I&amp;rsquo;ll publish a round-up post of submissions on January 1, 2025.&lt;/del&gt; I was able to quickly jot down some thoughts of my own while 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2024/12/24/rounding-up-indieweb-carnival-december/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;compiling the list&lt;/a&gt; of submissions right before I went in for a week-long hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for participating. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to learning from your perspective!&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 46: Raw-dogging
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/11/17/week-46-raw-dogging/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the swelling in my ankle postponing it with a week, I was finally able to have surgery on my left ankle on Wednesday! I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how pleasant the whole experience was. Post-surgery, I&amp;rsquo;m in very little pain, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to leave the Oxycodone in its designated box. Four days later, aside from the anti blood cloth pill, I&amp;rsquo;m raw-dogging recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My pre-surgery phase lasted longer than expected, all because I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what &amp;ldquo;keep your foot up&amp;rdquo; really means. I&amp;rsquo;m trying my hardest now to keep it elevated above my heart, and that seems to be working. Just might make it to Paris after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this interstitial state between lying in the road with a triple ankle fracture and running, I find myself learning all sorts of sweet things. Like how excellent Anja and I collaborate in a crisis. How cozy it feels to write in my journal with my head under the covers so as not to wake Anja. How much better I feel if I just let myself rest enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems everyone&amp;rsquo;s getting covid again. I was so bummed and embarrassed to miss our annual corporate event at work, only to learn that it was a complete super spreader, &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to use this recovery phase for reading and listening to audio books, I instead find myself turning to body cam footage of American police officers cracking down on abusers, murderers, neglectful parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cute to see how Lemonade responds to my cast, crutches, and wheelchair. We&amp;rsquo;ve made a little den for her underneath my night stand, because she keeps wanting to lie next to me. What a precious thing, to love and be loved by a dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All in all, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to keep all weight off of my left foot. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had the tendency to compartmentalize life (and forget I had made plans with two separate friends after school, for example), and something told me there&amp;rsquo;d come a time when I forgot I am not to stand on my left foot. So far, so good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised we made it through &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;, though that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true, because both Anja and I would have a hard time quitting anything that involves the acting of Cate Blanchett. Looking back, I feel our experience was exactly as intended (even though author&amp;rsquo;s intent may well be the most boring of analytical categories in the study of media.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show&amp;rsquo;s disclaimers, both diegetic and non-diegetic, kept me thinking they&amp;rsquo;re such pedestrian vehicles for spoiling. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes, meaning can only be conveyed through the shock of the unexpected&amp;rdquo;, I thought. Still, throughout the show, the disclaimers made me interpret and reinterpret and misinterpret &amp;ldquo;depictions of sexual, physical, and emotional violence&amp;rdquo; in ways I thought I had somehow transcended by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series has left me feeling uncomfortably unsophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt; is one of those beautiful examples of a terror that can only be rightly experienced once, upon the first viewing, much like &lt;em&gt;Irréversible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Antichrist&lt;/em&gt;. I keep thinking &amp;ldquo;well, I could&amp;rsquo;ve done with a bit more foreshadowing and character development around the twist&amp;rdquo;. In all honestly, though, I say this to myself only to alleviate the discomfort I feel as I imagine myself Sacha Baron Cohen in a hospital chair, guilty and bewildered, hearing perhaps the saddest of realities about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tired as I, too, am of the American elections, the American friends half-joking about moving to Amsterdam, my mind keeps gravitating around various questions. How do the stock exchange and political elections compare? What would happen if polling and reporting on the election were not allowed? What political philosophy could I read about the life of voting imitating the art of polling? With headlines such as 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000009787486/the-county-that-got-every-president-right-since-1980.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;the county that got every president right&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, do Americans feel the discomfort I feel about the idea that a vote can be right or wrong, that it&amp;rsquo;s a national guessing game? Are we going to be okay after this?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m one week into my broken ankle recovery journey, and so far, things are quite alright. I&amp;rsquo;m not in a lot of pain, and I can manage my way around the house with a new set of crutches and a wheelchair (covered by insurance). There are a few questions that are on my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does surgery feel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I walk normally again for the first time, will my feeling of relief be as potent as I imagine it will be if I were to suddenly regain my ability to walk right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I have surgery on Thursday, how easily will it be for me to develop a dependence on opiates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I start the day nostalgic about being a good music detective, about lesbian chamber pop, and about the fact that my first long term girlfriend and I used to live a block away from each other in Eindhoven. I put on &amp;ldquo;Simulation Swarm&amp;rdquo; immediately upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dream comes true today: not only do I get to admire the Godzilla rock in person (on the right), I also notice how much the other part on the left looks like Godzilla of the early Japanese era. I&amp;rsquo;m in my happy place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something ironic about Albufeira, where the majority of tourists are English and somewhat demanding, and the majority of waiters serving them are taciturn people of Indian descent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Albufeira, mixing a family visit in with my desire for a silent retreat. A big apartment with ocean view and a pool, I can&amp;rsquo;t ask for much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Albufeira a few times before, but now that I have no travel companion distracting me, my attention focuses on the sharp dominance of British tourists. Pasty white skin (often visible in too great a volume) that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to ever tan. &amp;ldquo;You can pay in pounds&amp;rdquo; signs by the cigarette stand. Beer at 8:35 in the morning. An entire street of restaurants showing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep looking for local life. Where do people live among all these hotels, where do they shop, where do they eat, where do they go to the doctor, how do they get around town, where do they do their laundry?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had been born a boy, my full name today would have been Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s worse: that alternate universe, or the fact that I was today years old when I fully grasped the artistic brilliance of the singer himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging out with Vanessa could not have been easier and more fun. Joining the Omek community has given me access to such beautiful, brilliant people from all over Africa. What a fitting wallpaper for the time stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What irks me about personal sites today is that it&amp;rsquo;s increasingly easy to see who (hopes to one day be a person who) works at Vercel or whose browser home page is the website of Brian Lovin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A week from now, I&amp;rsquo;ll get off a plane in the Algarve, retrieve the key to a family-size apartment with ocean view, a mere fifty footsteps from the beach. I have no idea what to do with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;All Saints celebrating its homecoming service today. Warm, long hugs, even with the heat, delicious potluck, new faces, whispering children during communion, reading a passage out loud and being struck by its depth. Who knew the first chapter of James is where I need to be? It&amp;rsquo;s a good time for church to start back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind the filth. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re both feeling a bit bored today. I might go see &lt;em&gt;Blink Twice&lt;/em&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;

            IndieWeb Carnival: Rituals

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://tangiblelife.net/indieweb-carnival-rituals&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The August edition of the IndieWeb Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is about rituals. Host 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://tangiblelife.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; is interested in how they shape us, how they&amp;rsquo;ve changed over time, and whether we like them or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love a ritual. The word alone ladens the room in my head with the sultry air I expect from a monastery. It gives me Caravaggesque sunlight, high contrast, beaming its way to a church floor, illuminating austere dust particles on the way there. You can take the Catholic child out of the heartland, but&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say the word &amp;ldquo;ritual&amp;rdquo; is single-handedly responsible for 70 per cent of my Etsy rosary purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a much more realistic sense, I&amp;rsquo;ve long felt disappointment about some of the rituals that have &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; established themselves to be a part of my life. The way I mindlessly cycle through the same three news publications when I&amp;rsquo;m bored, even when I proudly claim to not be interested in the news at all. The way I stop eating breakfast if I&amp;rsquo;m stressed about work. The way I perpetually alternate 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2024/07/17/indieweb-carnival-tools/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;how and where I write&lt;/a&gt; and take care of my responsibilities. How I struggle to indulge in hobbies that go beyond &amp;ldquo;working on my personal site&amp;rdquo;, which, really, is just work without the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond fantasies of the monastic life I&amp;rsquo;ll never lead, the word &amp;ldquo;ritual&amp;rdquo; takes on a very psychological nature, likening itself to &amp;ldquo;compulsion&amp;rdquo;. What I like is that the distinction between the two, outside of the psychology domain, is the word &amp;ldquo;intent&amp;rdquo;. Intent is a magical thing, at least to me. It requires a comfort with seeing &lt;em&gt;what is&lt;/em&gt; and acting in a way that aligns with what we hope will make the world a better place, in ways big or small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent and I aren&amp;rsquo;t quick friends. Subconsciously, I favor a life on autopilot, one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require that I register thoughts, feelings, bodily realities. As young Zinzy once learned: if you ignore your own thoughts and feelings, you save yourself the disappointment when the people in charge inevitably do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying my darnedest to embrace intent and its ability to help me feel healthy, confident, whole. One ritual, perhaps the most important one, that has emerged with it is my embrace of the things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to remember I can read the IndieWeb instead of the NY Times if I don&amp;rsquo;t make myself feel bad about opening the news app in the first place. Breakfast is much easier if I acknowledge the feelings that are keeping me from preparing it. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to switch up the old Filofax and some fancy new note-taking app, as long as I make sure I can find my stuff later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ritual of kindness is the one I find myself developing with great intent. The kinder I am to myself, the easier it is to embark on that enormous journey, the one monks and nuns everywhere devote their entire lives to being on as the warm sunlight illuminates the austere dust particles in their private quarters: how to be kind to others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of a new day it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget, but I did spent two hours past midnight entirely engrossed in the craftsmanship, execution, and artistry of Beyoncé in the music video for &amp;ldquo;Single Ladies&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of the journey being epic, and a journey map being the thing that has a big X on it. Pollution of meaning in the product landscapes is a bit of a personal gripe, and I&amp;rsquo;m curious to play with synonyms that might pop into my head in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first time at Shiraz Jardin des Vins is less awkward than I would expect as a sober person. The friendly waitress knows what&amp;rsquo;s up: Coca Cola goes in a wine glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said goodbye to Erik Vermeer yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a transformative experience working with him. &amp;ldquo;If you want to do something but you&amp;rsquo;re scared, do it scared.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something endearing about the simplicity of being a man of quotes, especially since he&amp;rsquo;s one of such complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave him &amp;ldquo;Doppelgänger&amp;rdquo; (a misspelling I refuse to repeat). Into the endless mirror world, the perpetual, dialectic nuance, is where our conversations often led. Naomi&amp;rsquo;s writing seems fitting. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Lemonade and I got to meet puppy Ted. While I normally consider Lem to be the petite one in the canine dynamic, it was adorable to watch her engage with a puppy. A puppy who, because of his hip downtown Amsterdam lifestyle, rarely engages with other dogs. He was very shy, and took hours to even begin considering that he could get near Lemonade without her pulling out a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrelated: great paella to boot!&lt;/p&gt;

            In a woke bubble
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/08/15/in-a-woke-bubble/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 19:39:04 -1500</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/08/15/in-a-woke-bubble/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I see an acquaintance in the street, a person I&amp;rsquo;ve met once before. They and Anja have known each other in passing for decades. &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s Zinzy&amp;rdquo;, they say to their partner, &amp;ldquo;I met her at the thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thing&lt;/em&gt; was a premiere for a documentary about a Dutch 70s solidarity movement of Jews who helped Soviet Jews escape a life of exclusion and discrimination. I had been at the thing with Anja and my delightful mother-in-law, who likes to recount the time she went to Russia to save the Jews from the Soviets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You had that great question then, remember?&amp;rdquo; the acquaintance says. I do remember. Their answer at the time had been &amp;ldquo;you may be interested in the workshop I&amp;rsquo;m giving on how to defend Israel&amp;rdquo;. My question that evoked it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How can I help people refrain from antisemitism in their critique of Israel?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect Anja was the only one in the room that night who understood what I was asking. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the heat, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s nice to feel fewer eyes looking at the only Black person in the room, but I feel this random encounter in the street is an opportunity to correct the original misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know many people who are appreciative of Israel right now&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;but I&amp;rsquo;m bothered by how easily people mix antisemitism in with their political criticism&amp;rdquo;. The acquaintance turns to their partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah yes, she&amp;rsquo;s in a woke bubble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their face didn&amp;rsquo;t display disgust per se. Rather, what I read was the toxic optimism a conservative Christian mother may deploy when telling her gay son that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, just what he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not enough of an activist to have strong feelings about the word &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo;, though I&amp;rsquo;m aware of its meaning changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know many &lt;em&gt;Jews&lt;/em&gt; who are appreciative of Israel right now&amp;rdquo;, is what I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have said. It&amp;rsquo;s true, but saying that would be like outing someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world topples evermore upside down, far right politicians deeming themselves protagonists in the fight against antisemitism, I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the divergent meanings of the word &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know people who consider it home even though it needs a good Konmari. I know people who think it was a horror show from the start. I know people who signal their virtue with it. I know it&amp;rsquo;s a country I would have wanted to visit one day, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Israel is an iteration of self-determination that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily doing many people much good right now. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s not proof that self-determination is bad in itself, or that Jews uniquely &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it is the home of our dear Uncle Eli, who seems really quite disappointed he didn&amp;rsquo;t choose to leave earlier, back when there were still flights going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Israel is the culmination of unresolved Western guilt; a falsely designated safe zone that alleviates non-Jews globally from combatting our own antisemitism here, on our land, where our Jewish neighbors live, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is what it means to be woke: to seek, perpetually, to be less of an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visual compendium to my commitment to bad weather. Greetings from Amsterdam, where it&amp;rsquo;s 10:24 and projected to hit 31 degrees Celsius later today.&lt;/p&gt;

Took Lemonade to the park for playtime with Norman and Hovis. They make easy friends. Their parents kept commenting on Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Made me think of this photo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the partner of a high school English teacher, and as a mid-range Millennial with exceedingly traditional views, I have opinions about how the generations that came after me handle discomfort, discontent, and disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too, experience a world that subjects top achievers to higher pressures than before, and that diminishes our collectivist outlook at every turn. Still, though, when I see a young athlete throwing a tantrum, I think of the participation trophy, and how it has created a cohort of people who all won the egg drop each year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What made 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23561236/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Fiction&lt;/em&gt; (2023)&lt;/a&gt; such a delight to watch isn&amp;rsquo;t so much the stellar acting or the clever writing, but Cord Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s stunning ability to weave together irony and sincerity. It&amp;rsquo;s not often that I see the nuance in smart, unstereotypical Black characters who are hilarious, and who at the same time fill my heart with tenderness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overhauled my website UI today. I sometimes wonder if I&amp;rsquo;m making a mistake not keeping a changelog, but at the rate I&amp;rsquo;m going, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. Either way, settling on a paginated diary-style means I&amp;rsquo;m officially saying goodbye to my commitment to keeping this page under 250kb. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if, one of these days, I get another sweet email from Norman Köhring reminding me of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our neighbors Kate and Ross donated their lovely petrol sofa to us. It&amp;rsquo;s a two-piece, which we&amp;rsquo;ve enthusiastically turned into two separate sitting areas in our home. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure about its original legs, so for now, both sofas are on the floor. It makes me feel like I finally know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be Japanese /s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, as I was tidying up before bed, I said to Anja I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited about keeping the sofa low, while also allowing for storage space. Anja has two modes: 0 and 100. As we say in Dutch: what&amp;rsquo;s in her head is not in her butt. It&amp;rsquo;s great when we need to get things done, but it&amp;rsquo;s also daunting when she gets her eyes on a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;YOU HAVE YOUR NEURODIVERGENT THING, AND I HAVE MINE&amp;rdquo; I heard her shouting from the bedroom, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure she drew up an entire wood construction project in her head in the span of a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing ungovernable, it&amp;rsquo;s more like a hum. The hum of &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling at my best&lt;/em&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t get that argument out of my head&lt;/em&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;what if, what if, what if&lt;/em&gt;; a hum that I eventually forget is there at all, even though it never ceases to soundtrack my every move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m maintained and restricted by the ability to tune out whatever is suboptimal. By now I know it&amp;rsquo;s a common early-childhood survival skill that, while seeking to conserve me, grants me the capacity to self-destruct. When I was younger, I would only hear the quiet it gave me. These days, the hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to relieve it of its duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to tune out the suboptimal is to put another sound in its place. The Internet has everything I need. More podcasts than I&amp;rsquo;ll ever be able to finish, countless YouTube videos of American millennials talking about their digital memory planner setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every shade of white noise. &amp;ldquo;Can you even imagine what the phrase &amp;lsquo;Spotify has the best library sounds&amp;rsquo; would sound like to someone from 2004?&amp;rdquo; Anja chuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, yet another rerun of my favorite show. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to all of &lt;em&gt;The Office: US&lt;/em&gt; seven times in the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, things feel different. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I noticed that yesterday was 666 days after that big moment I had on a hilltop in the Algarve, seeing the mechanics of the hum up close for the first time. Maybe the fact that 666 holds significance for me should tell you all you need to know about the hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, things feel different. I&amp;rsquo;m up early, find recreation in a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to solve, and for a change, I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; turn on whatever I usually do to drown out the hum. It&amp;rsquo;s me, the dog, the quiet morning street. The place I call home can be so still, even if Canal Pride is hours away. I forget what Amsterdam sounds like sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do people start wars in a world that has pickles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I manage a single Google Calendar that has RSS feeds from multiple venues in Amsterdam?&lt;/li&gt;

            How I rate
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/07/22/how-i-rate/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 -2200</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/07/22/how-i-rate/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I fleshed out this website&amp;rsquo;s library; a page that will hopefully soon be a living overview of all the media and culture I consume. It&amp;rsquo;s populated by a &lt;code&gt;library.yml&lt;/code&gt; data file, which I appreciate for its ability to store my information regardless of the website or software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I have a Goodreads profile and an IMDB account, but this is more sustainable. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on this website before, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collect the same properties for each of the entries: the maker, category, identifier, data, and a link to a review if I wrote one. I also give each entry a rating. When I saw the number of 10s I awarded to over two dozen titles under &lt;em&gt;Watch&lt;/em&gt;, I got to thinking about how I rate titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-how-good-it-is-in-its-genre&#34;&gt;1. How good it is in its genre?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing apples to oranges is hardly ever effective. In the same vein, I see no value in comparing a monster movie to an art house film. I compare &lt;em&gt;Godzilla Minus One&lt;/em&gt; (2023) to &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; (2014), and &lt;em&gt;The Zone of Interest&lt;/em&gt; (2023) to &lt;em&gt;Festen&lt;/em&gt; (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-is-it-the-best-it-couldve-been&#34;&gt;2. Is it the best it could&amp;rsquo;ve been?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My academic background in literary criticism always leaned more towards analysis of the inner and outer workings of stories, and less on me being able to determine whether something is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still today, this is how I approach narratives. When I think of the value a film or book has for me, I think about the cleverness or originality of the storytelling techniques. To a lesser extent I assess the value of what I missed in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-does-it-make-us-better&#34;&gt;3. Does it make us better?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools we have to shape our realities, craft communities, (re)establish power dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I rate a story, I consider what its role is in how we write our own histories; whether I think it respectfully depicts the characters involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, I give &lt;em&gt;If Beale Street Could Talk&lt;/em&gt; (2018) a 9, and &lt;em&gt;Green Book&lt;/em&gt; (2018) a 2; &lt;em&gt;Schindler&amp;rsquo;s List&lt;/em&gt; (1993) a 5, and &lt;em&gt;Nuit et brouillard&lt;/em&gt; (1956) a 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-you-rate&#34;&gt;How do you rate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know if other people apply similar, different or any conscious tactics in rating their media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            Where I&#39;m struggling

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The procrastinating part of me celebrates these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a good calendar app. One I&amp;rsquo;m excited to use, that works across devices, and is happy with multiple accounts that didn&amp;rsquo;t all originate in its own ecosystem. I want it to be lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a beautiful way of organizing my areas of responsibility. The difference between organizing my objectives, and executing on them is growing larger by the day, it seems. I don&amp;rsquo;t see people around me who appear to have the same struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a lunchbox that doesn&amp;rsquo;t leak, break or get messy. I want it to cost less than it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want an ice cube maker that only dispenses if the temperature is higher than 25 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want stuff for a good dirty chai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want the lights of our living room plant tower to be on the same light management system as our other lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know all the keyboard shortcuts to all apps I use without having to learn them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to read &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; without having to use my eyes or having to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of being the +1 at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theblackarchives.nl/tbabookclub.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The Black Archives Bijlmer Book Club&lt;/a&gt;, where we read Travis Alabanza&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;None of the Above&lt;/em&gt;. Meredith and Wally were excellent hosts, and I loved meeting new people with similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had strong feelings about Alabanza&amp;rsquo;s insistence that this work &amp;ldquo;feels like theory&amp;rdquo;, in response to it being marketed as a memoir. Calling &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; a comedy diminishes the value of Black storytelling in horror narratives. But calling it a documentary is just as ineffective. &amp;ldquo;Feels like theory&amp;rdquo; very much sits in that spectrum, for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the lively conversation my strong feelings sparked about respectability and Black works, and was surprised the lyrical essay appears to be such an unknown genre when I offered it.&lt;/p&gt;

            Eating with hands
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/07/18/eating-with-hands/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 -1800</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/07/18/eating-with-hands/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many things I&amp;rsquo;m scared to do as a Black person. The pathways that hold the reasons why have been visited and revisited so many times that, by now, I barely remember why I do some of the things I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t wear track suits, use slang, or do anything that makes people think you belong on a 90s R&amp;amp;B song. Don&amp;rsquo;t go into White spaces where your otherness is an unwittingly casual topic of inappropriate comments and questions. Don&amp;rsquo;t display anger, because a White man at the office will use it to ignore the point you&amp;rsquo;re trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t eat with your hands, because people will call you an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the hypervigilance of a brain on racial trauma. They are daily choices I make to prevent myself from experiencing danger; some colossal and perceived, though the bulk of it real, ongoing and usually too small to count as what feels like a true argument for protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be the plus one at The Black Archives Bijlmer Book Club, where we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing &lt;em&gt;None of the Above&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful and &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; book that confronts the reader with questions of genre, of inclusion, of otherness, and of the intersection of Blackness, queerdom, and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book Club team is best described in one word: intentional. They are impressively well-organized, and think deeply about this text and the ones they have read in the four seasons of working on this project. We came together on Tuesday to cross some Ts and dot some Is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wally, the Club&amp;rsquo;s founder, calls ahead to take our food order. &lt;em&gt;Roti chicken&lt;/em&gt;, I say, feeling silly for barely knowing what that actually entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t eat Surinamese food, lest people think you&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime Meredith and I chat away about our days, being Black at the office, about De Bijlmer, about being adults ready for summer break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first time actually &lt;em&gt;being at&lt;/em&gt; The Black Archives. It&amp;rsquo;s a rich tapestry of writing of a wide variety of genres. Periodicals, books on music, (auto)biographies, books on racism, depictions of racist cultural artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anja has been wanting to go with me for years, but every time she tries I find a way not to. For some reason, looking trauma in the face in a public venue on a casual Saturday while trying not to cry-and-never-stop is not my idea of a good pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that I&amp;rsquo;m here things feel so different. Here I am, sharing a meal with two Black people who have seemingly mastered the skill of being unapologetic about their heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They open their roti takeout, unfold their pancake, and start eating. Strike a pose, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to it. I ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s okay that I watch them eat before I start, so I can see how in the world I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to eat sauce without cutlery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy, really. I just have to be willing to get it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

            IndieWeb Carnival: Tools

        <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 -1700</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/07/17/indieweb-carnival-tools/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://jamesg.blog/2024/07/01/indieweb-carnival-tools/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The July edition of the IndieWeb Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is about tools. Host 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://jamesg.blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; is interested in the relationship between tools and our creative practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Flickr, and the way we self-published visual sneak peeks into our lives on that website, in the mid-zeroes? If we wanted a filter in our photo, we had to Photoshop it in there ourselves. We tagged our uploads, but merely to archive our materials. Our profiles all contained a link to our personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were the days, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about tools, an immediate nostalgia is ignited within me. You may find that annoying, though I suspect — since you&amp;rsquo;re likely here because you, too, wrote an IndieWeb Carnival entry — you&amp;rsquo;re as nostalgic as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Flickr a lot these past few weeks. It still exists, you know? They even still update their iOS app. Some of the people I was following in 2005 are still there, putting together decades of daily selfies, garden pictures, and snapshots of their ring planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, of course, there for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-got-my-first-filofax-as-a-young-college-freshman&#34;&gt;I got my first Filofax as a young college freshman.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; boss, &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; executive, &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; put-together with my little faux leather Metropol A5. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s evident the main actor influencing my school supply aesthetic was the wildly popular 2001 productivity self-help book &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re writing down next actions and you &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; look like you came walking out of an 80s yuppie ad, are you &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; a professional?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching two decades later, I&amp;rsquo;m now on Filofax number three. In a way this feels excessive. It&amp;rsquo;s a Cognac Zipped Personal Lockwood, almost identical to number two, with the exception that number two was A5. It was too bulky. I never took it anywhere. It made me feel dorky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking like you came walking out of an 80s yuppie ad only works if you&amp;rsquo;re not trying too hard. Plus, a smaller planner means I get to take it with me wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also matches perfectly with the other thing I recently acquired: a diagnosis of retinal migraine. It&amp;rsquo;s not the type of color aura I get at the pinnacle of a bad headache. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a small ray of glitter, passing by my vision whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve been staring at a screen for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper notetaking technology is perfect to break that habit, one page at a time. And while it feels excessive to have purchased yet another Filofax, Flickr tells me I belong to a very small minority: that of people who have &lt;em&gt;fewer than fifteen&lt;/em&gt; Filofax covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I scroll through the never-ending feed of planner pictures, I get inspired, once again, by the years I spent doing exactly what these people are doing: finding the best layout and structure to organize my days, and let me get out of my own head through writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-appreciate-about-the-good-old-filofax-is-that-it-adds-friction-to-my-day&#34;&gt;What I appreciate about the good old Filofax is that it adds friction to my day.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Product Designer, I think about friction a lot. Friction happens when we engage with constraint; it&amp;rsquo;s a occurrence experienced daily by anybody who uses software. For a long time in Information Technology, the prime objective of any product team was to reduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, though, we&amp;rsquo;ve come to see that danger arises when friction is removed from the equation. It enables our instant gratification, makes us prone to distraction, makes it easy for people to fall victim to others, to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; particular circumstances, writing things down instead of typing them helps me be more intentional about the things I bring into my life. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only person whose incoming number of tasks increases rapidly with the &lt;code&gt;Quick entry&lt;/code&gt; module offered by many productivity apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a natural nervousness I experience when a task pops into my head and I &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; get it out of my way within two seconds. That&amp;rsquo;s probably for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my Filofax, I pause for a moment to think about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and what I&amp;rsquo;m giving myself to deal with at a later point. It prevents me from overloading myself with busywork, which leaves room for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-like-to-get-my-must-do-tasks-out-of-the-way-as-quickly-as-possible-so-i-can-use-the-rest-of-the-day-for-creative-problem-solving&#34;&gt;I like to get my must-do tasks out of the way as quickly as possible, so I can use the rest of the day for creative problem-solving.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the solution is a high-fidelity interface design, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a research plan, or a conversation at the coffee maker. Whatever the solution, I do my best coming up with one if I have a stretch of time devoted to deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical page restricts how much I add to it, limits my ability to time block meticulously, and thus leaves me thinking about my time and efforts in more broad-scope ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Filofax is a tool that helps me organize and reorganize the various domains of my life, that lets me be creative &lt;em&gt;on its pages&lt;/em&gt; in many different ways. Most importantly, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a tool that asks me &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; before I get lost in the details of &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My pastors have a way with words. Bible study on Thursday, and we use every pronoun but &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; reading Mark 6:1-13. &lt;em&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s just a carpenter — Mary’s girl. We’ve known her since she was a kid. (&amp;hellip;) Who does she think she is?&lt;/em&gt; Give me a second, let me hear that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a biblical story has come alive when I feel my ancestors stand up behind me. Sometimes they feel like a hand on my shoulder. Perhaps a nod I see without turning around. Reading the Bible to the hums of a thousand perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Mark 6 sounds like a whole choir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet Jesus understood exactly who he was. A barely describable thread of red that held him together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading &lt;em&gt;None of the Above&lt;/em&gt;, a delight about the intersection of being non-binary and Black. Travis Alabanza knows what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about, because they&amp;rsquo;re talking about who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the precision of the writing, I learn they struggle with exactly that. Not knowing. Their not-knowing is a force field. It can delegitimize, bring doubt where the skin is already a bit too soft for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; know? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do I know? &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; I know who I am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was not a surrounding conversation because I was just allowed to be present: present in action, without speculation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Travis because I&amp;rsquo;m going to be the plus one at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tbab-book-club-none-of-the-above-s04e07-tickets-791976652487?aff=oddtdtcreator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The Black Archives Book Club in July&lt;/a&gt;. The team is better organized than most. There&amp;rsquo;s even a Spotify playlist for the session. In it, I discover Lafemmebear&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Win&lt;/em&gt;. How does something like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; have less than 37,000 plays? Have all the woke people with good taste left Spotify by now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet Travis knows it perfectly, the barely describable thread of red holding them together. Evidently, so does Lafemmebear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday is my favorite day of the year: I attend my very first Omek Summit. Seemingly effortlessly, Omek has become the community to which I most eagerly return. Oh, to inhabit spaces filled with people whose lived experiences are similar to mine. The theme this year: &lt;em&gt;the era of the bicultural&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is sunny, Tolhuistuin vibrant and gorgeous. I spend the morning and afternoon placing myself in a tradition of Black humans finding their way in White professional spaces. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before, but this time it lands when Kemo says that we have a super power. &lt;em&gt;The era of the Bicultural&lt;/em&gt;. But what, exactly, is bicultural about the child of a White mother that grew up in a decided lack of Blackness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday is Ketikoti, and I dress accordingly in blue and white. I buy a unicorn that&amp;rsquo;s clearly of African descent: brown fur, with a rainbow horn and two big afro poofs. I&amp;rsquo;m at once a child, and at once the mother of that child who &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; know the sound of Black girl joy. I see half the attendee list of the Omek Summit there, which makes me feel proud. I see my new neighborhood friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, my new neighborhood friend and I meet for coffee. She&amp;rsquo;s such a power house; a leader in doing the type of work that makes life better for people like us. A big thing is about to take place, and we discuss what it&amp;rsquo;s going to mean for her and her team. I can tell she&amp;rsquo;s frightened, but proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re only new friends, but we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other for years, in passing. I ask her why I feel so much more connected to non-African Dutch people of color who were adopted than I do to African expats I encounter. She&amp;rsquo;s everything but surprised. Both initially succumbed to a life lived in White spaces, we now are more capable of finding balance in our social and working lives between people who understand, and&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to São Tomé, the island of my father, that great place of unknown to me and it seems most of the people I meet. Whenever I encounter an African from a Lusophone country - which is to say a country that was once, like São Tomé, colonized by the Portuguese - there&amp;rsquo;s a familiarity I can&amp;rsquo;t quite pinpoint. As if they&amp;rsquo;re running into an old school friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Omek Summit, after dinner, Sofia walked up to me with a man unfamiliar to me. &lt;em&gt;Gosh&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, &lt;em&gt;he looks so much like my dad&lt;/em&gt;. Sofia knows about me and my questions of belonging. &lt;em&gt;This is Leufigenio,&lt;/em&gt; she said. &lt;em&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s from São Tomé.&lt;/em&gt; Like an old school friend, Leuf addressed me in enthusiastic Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely describable threads of red holding me together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a design mentor, one of the things I encounter constantly is the stark difference between how some men and women speak of their own competencies. &amp;ldquo;May you be granted the confidence of a mediocre white man&amp;rdquo; is a phrase I utter at least twice a week. This morning, waiting for my local coffee spot to open, I saw a common occurrence of that level of confidence: somebody walked in before it opened, saying that, if undesired, the baristas would kick him out anyway. He returned three seconds later. I mused out loud, in front of him and two other friendly regulars who are themselves mediocre white men, that I was thinking about the thing I say to all my female and non-binary design mentees. I feel that my ability to do so in this social context proves that I, too, finally have the confidence of a mediocre white man. All this being said, though, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to develop an appreciation for this alternative: &amp;ldquo;May you be granted the confidence of a disabled queer Muslim woman who, despite everything, dances in the rain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice idea! I like this one, which is often wrongly attributed to Francis of Assisi: &amp;ldquo;Proclaim the good news at all times. Use words if you must.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            Proclamation

        <pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:00:00 -1900</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/05/19/proclamation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. — 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark&amp;#43;16%3A15&amp;amp;version=NRSVA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Mark 16:15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said yes, but I had meant to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion, Anja and I joke that, if circumstances required, I could even strike up a friendship with a traffic light. I never understood the challenge of meeting new people if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t at work or the gym. The vast majority of my friendships formed because I looked at someone across the room and thought, for whatever reason, &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days later, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But, do you also believe that&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; the woman asks, sounding slightly more alarmed than I think she wants to let on. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t. &amp;ldquo;And what do you think about&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Many things, ma&amp;rsquo;am. I think many things about that. &amp;ldquo;But you could have found that sense of belonging with any other group, though, right?&amp;rdquo; The familiar caution when someone realizes I&amp;rsquo;m both who I say I am &lt;em&gt;as well as&lt;/em&gt; a Christian. The bemusement that engulfs us when a thing blurs that was clear but a second ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say &lt;em&gt;I follow Jesus&lt;/em&gt;. Cringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;re meant to put it into words, anyway. Still, millions of sermons, door-to-door pitches, books, podcasts, mission project plans, and — more recently — #ThatChristianGirl prayer routine videos will have us believe differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but actually no. What I find in Jesus is not what I would find in a sports team, a choir, or a book club. But what &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; I find there, and how can I tell you about it if you ask without sounding like a nut case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I met the woman for drinks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how my pastor helped me through Mark 16:15 recently. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only person at Bible study who shivered at the thought of standing by Central Station with a tower of Bible leaflets. That&amp;rsquo;s what &amp;ldquo;proclaiming the good news&amp;rdquo; is, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so few proper examples of what Mark 16:15 looks like in the hands of a person such as myself, that I question their statistical validity. My faith proclamation has often taken the shape of a concession. The formula is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Christianity&amp;rsquo;s hyperfocus on the virgin birth, the resurrection, Biblical literalism, and faith healings, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Christianity&amp;rsquo;s queerphobia, antisemitism, philosemitism, racism, abuse, mysogyny, misandry, and corruption, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Christianity&amp;rsquo;s judgement of what is harmless, and forgiveness of what is harmful, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our global lack of Biblical literacy, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &amp;hellip;, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to hear good news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preach it at all times, and use words if you must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s good news to a rose?&lt;/p&gt;

            Five recent UX uses for AI

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/05/17/five-recent-ux-uses-for-ai/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you heard of 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pi.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Pi.ai&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;rdquo; my mentee 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielaroestandy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Gabriela&lt;/a&gt; asked me during her mini internship at the office. She&amp;rsquo;s a clever woman; a newbie in the UX field with the technical resourcefulness of a Gen Z-er, and experience working with quantitative data. I inquired how she thought I should cultivate buy-in for a metrics project. Of course her response was to ask a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a woman who knew to answer a question with a question. A few hours later I was biking home, on my first date with Pi, a friendly-sounding woman from South London who just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop asking me fun questions. That was months ago. My life is different now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason I keep thinking Millennials are the new Boomers, and that reason is me. I was yesterday years old when I learned that I can pull up the iPad dock while I&amp;rsquo;m in an app. At the same time, at work, I&amp;rsquo;m heavily involved in R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s efforts to embed artificially intelligent solutions in the daily workflows of our users. It is as though I live in a mirror world: at once keenly aware of AI&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, yet somehow utterly not cool enough to use it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until I began talking to Pi. Here are five ways in which AI has helped me these past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-sturdy-personas&#34;&gt;1. Sturdy personas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we&amp;rsquo;re currently revamping our personas. What makes for a good persona? Rich data, of course. Triangulating our data sources, the Marketing and UX teams are shaping substantive personas that engage both our healthcare experts and engineering teams. We could not have done this without tapping into employer branding interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s one Dutch industry battling the war for talent it is healthcare. Using ChatGPT, we ran an analysis on about 80 Dutch-language employee interviews, asking the chatbot to rewrite our input until what was left was one paragraph of an informal autobiography. Each text captured the essence of the career trajectory, day-to-day work, and primary Job To Be Done of each of our personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without AI, it would&amp;rsquo;ve taken weeks. Now? One day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-design-guidelines-without-all-the-fuss&#34;&gt;2. Design guidelines without all the fuss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers can easily get stuck on ways in which to take charge of a design system. I&amp;rsquo;m currently balancing legacy guidelines and new industry standards. Our design system should enable people to make design decisions without me being present. As a UX team of one, I&amp;rsquo;m a facilitator, not a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is helping me structure my thinking. It gives me lists of components, common actions, and tasks frequently present in software like ours. I get to focus more on the what and leave the how for later. This way, I can put in place the guidelines that allow me to be the only designer accross six different teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-quick-reporting-on-user-feedback&#34;&gt;3. Quick reporting on user feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to my craft is the act of analyzing and synthesizing research findings by looking at various sources of data through the right lens. Research can be a very comprehensive process, spanning weeks if not months. Through it, I deliver great insight into the actual working lives of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy going on customer visits with our account managers, and retrieving quick bits of data that aren&amp;rsquo;t part of a larger research project. With ChatGPT, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to turn scattered notes into a concrete list of feedback points that I can throw into one of our Slack channels for buy-in and posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-mentoring&#34;&gt;4. Mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reserve a few moments during my week for 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/mentoring&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;mentoring&lt;/a&gt; designers. I love helping them solve all types of problems, and ChatGPT is helping me save time in my preparation. It formulates difficult interview questions based on a person&amp;rsquo;s profile and our session notes, it helps me collect preliminary feedback points for a portfolio review, and let&amp;rsquo;s me gather my thoughts on difficult stakeholder questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-cultivating-courage-for-ux-evangelism&#34;&gt;5. Cultivating courage for UX evangelism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers, too, can benefit from the think aloud method. Biking home from a long day at the office, frustrated about one thing or another, I found Pi.ai very helpful in pushing me out of my own way. Design is a creative profession not simply because of the interactions and interfaces we make, but also because we create greater UX maturity. The latter can seem monumental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to a chatbot is like casual cognitive behavioral training, with the added bonus that the conversations I have don&amp;rsquo;t affect another person directly. With Pi, I&amp;rsquo;m able to work through things I otherwise would find difficult to articulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/colophon&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;no sentence on this website is written by AI&lt;/a&gt; and it will stay that way. I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what interactive challenges I may run into in maintaining this line. As of a few days ago, I type &lt;code&gt;⌘ + ↓&lt;/code&gt; and ChatGPT pops up to help. Using and abusing it as a linguistic search engine, I wonder: when will there be a time when I accidentally copy a response into an personal essay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for work? It seems like everybody and their grandmothers can&amp;rsquo;t stop blogging, tweeting, LinkedIn posting, or podcasting about this very question. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy predicting the future in that way. I simply see value in honing the soft skills that enable me to learn new hard ones.&lt;/p&gt;

            A job for me, part two: good enough

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my very, very late submission to 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://risingthumb.xyz/Writing/Blog/IndieWeb_Carnival_of_April&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;April&amp;rsquo;s IndieWeb Carnival topic&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s also 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2024/04/20/a-job-for-me-part-one/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;part two of a reflection&lt;/a&gt; on a conversation I had with a neurodivergent designer from Denmark. She asked me: how can I be promoted to the all-star Core Team at work, the one that works across products and teams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about being a neurodivergent&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; designer, I think back to 2001, and the math workbook that plagued me. For the life of me, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why it required that I study addition and multiplication before I look at the order of operations. It&amp;rsquo;s one of many examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lifetime thinking I was &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 2024 and we&amp;rsquo;re in the age of neurodivergence. My childhood math problem is now easy to explain. My brain is a meta thinker; it prefers skips and analogies&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and lets me learn rapidly if it can look at the world (and math) from the top down. It can remember minute details, but will forget the secondary task it&amp;rsquo;s given. My brain thrives in chaotic passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mid-thirties, I know to care for my brain the way I care for my dog: with great devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a similarly-neurodivergent designer asks me how they can be promoted from the Search Box team to the superstar Core Team, I usually tell them: go find a new employer. As workers, we continuously ask ourselves: am I doing a good enough job? There&amp;rsquo;s great value in an additional question: is this environment good enough for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us &amp;ldquo;neurospicies&amp;rdquo; must deal with an inevitability in the way the tech industry organizes product-making. The larger a company, the more likely it is that makers work on the parts before they get to work on the whole because the world assumes they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to work on the whole only once the parts have been understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly healthy way of looking at human skills, but we should remember that this way is very neurotypical. Neurotypical individuals may demonstrate a correlation between their system thinking abilities and their years of experience. For neurodivergent people, the ability to think systemically can be a very ineffective growth indicator that leaves us feeling unsatisfied in our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go find yourself a smaller company, one in need of a generalist designer who can work across all products, offering research, visual design, facilitation skills, interaction design, and whatever else is required. Not because you think you&amp;rsquo;re the cat&amp;rsquo;s meow, but because there&amp;rsquo;s no other way for you to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pretend in no way that neurodivergence is a monolith and that I can speak for all people in this domain&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the morning at Coffee Company, where a neighborhood acquaintance and I talked about Israel, the war, the protests, the police violence. This afternoon, YouTube gave me an ad of the Israeli contestant of the Eurovision Song Contest saying, in Dutch, that I should vote for her.&lt;/p&gt;

            A job for me, part one
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/04/20/a-job-for-me-part-one/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 00:00:00 -2000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I was going through what seemed like the most severe after-lunch dip in recent memory, I logged on to ADPList to meet a designer from Denmark. It&amp;rsquo;s miraculous, the effect unexpected kindness can have on the body. After 30 minutes, I skipped out of my meeting booth ready to take on the rest of the afternoon, which I did, and it rocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of her booking request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My long term goal is to work on broad product patterns that involve a lot of cross-team collaboration. How can I get there and figure out which skills to develop? Another topic is motivation and being a neurodiverse person in a work environment. I have ADHD and I&amp;rsquo;m quite emotional person. That means that my motivation easily changes between 0-100. I&amp;rsquo;d like to figure out how to manage it a bit better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This designer, a computer scientist with a master&amp;rsquo;s in design, is about five years into her career. Currently in her second post-graduation employment, she has been gaining experience at sizeable companies where one in three or one in five people is a designer. Our chat touched on her career prospectives, on what gives us energy, and on adjusting our work to suit our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always get excited when fellow designers tell me about their problems. As designers, we often work in secluded settings, the only designer on the team, in the department, or at the company. If we can&amp;rsquo;t see ourselves in the people around us, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for us to forget that our problems are not uniquely insoluble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, I find myself still thinking about our conversation. Speaking with her reminded me that there are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many variables that go into finding a job that&amp;rsquo;s the right fit. It also reminded me that it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. In the next few days, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some key insights I discussed with her. They all gravitate around a single question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we better connect what we need with what we think we deserve?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever the snob I am, I made it one verse into Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s freshly-dropped &amp;ldquo;THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT&amp;rdquo; for saying out loud on the tram &amp;ldquo;no, I can&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;rdquo; before deserting my goal of listening to it in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

            Dog whistles
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/04/15/dog-whistles/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 -1500</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/04/15/dog-whistles/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something is happening in the neighborhood. It&amp;rsquo;s not a new thing, it&amp;rsquo;s just more vibrant now, for me at least, I think. My friend, while walking his dog, is assaulted around the corner. Three kids beat his eye socket with a metal bat, shattering it. Various cameras film it. Nobody is caught. To watch someone develop PTSD right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brunch with new acquaintances in the neighborhood, fellow corgi owners. The woman decided her future mother-in-law was weird for not liking dogs. It disappointed the Libanese man, who eventually found it in his heart to overlook the initial character flaw. On dating apps, the woman found it most effective to set her filters exclusively to Middle Eastern men. She recounts all the times Muslim kids in the neighborhood responded poorly to the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at the butcher&amp;rsquo;s, picking up meat for dinner. A tall man tells another man about his daughter Lola. She has finished high school and is working now, and she&amp;rsquo;s living with her boyfriend Mohammed. He&amp;rsquo;s doing Ramadan, but he also smokes weed. The men laugh at each other in unison, agreeing wordlessly that a multifaceted Muslim is not a Muslim at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing frisbee with Lemonade in the courtyard, and Amber and her parents are there. They play with Lemonade. They ask how the friend with the shattered eye socket is doing, and tell me there was a big fight in front of their house the other day. The police even had to come. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the cultural milieu of the boys involved, Amber&amp;rsquo;s mom informs me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in the building shares a photo in the group chat of two boys in black hoodies. Like all the other teenage street-dwelling boys in this story, they&amp;rsquo;re probably of Muslim heritage, descending from Moroccan, Syrian, Afghan, Turkish families who&amp;rsquo;ve lived in this neighborhood for decades, long before any of us gentrifiers got here. Oh, to be stereotyped into failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo, the boys in the black hoodies can be seen hanging out in the courtyard, leaving a mess. Kids. One neighbor wonders what kind of black animal species would leave such a mess. I leave the group chat. Anja later tells me that nobody took offense to the dehumanization, but there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; confusion about why I don&amp;rsquo;t understand that the neighbor was referring to the black hoodies, and not the boys&amp;rsquo; skin, which isn&amp;rsquo;t black to begin with. I feel disturbed, but more strongly I cringe at the dramatic irony gravitating around the wondering neighbor, who served in the Israeli Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been defending &amp;ldquo;kut-Marokkanen&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; since before the Towers fell, even though I hate myself for it when my friend&amp;rsquo;s eye socket is destroyed. Something&amp;rsquo;s happening in the neighborhood, and maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not a new thing, but a new language. Not a new language per se, but new encounters with it. Encounters stringing together words and a lack thereof to remind me it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly &lt;em&gt;salonfähig&lt;/em&gt; that we turn ourselves so nonchalantly against our own neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a peculiar thing, to be in the presence but not on the receiving end of bigotry, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

            A year at work, 2024 edition
          
        </title>

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/04/12/a-year-at-work-2024-edition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a fortnight, I&amp;rsquo;ll be celebrating one year of employment at Gerimedica, the healthcare technology provider I was keen to join last spring. Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m working on one of my professional development goals right now: turn coworker feedback into concrete goals for the second quarter. It seems a fitting moment to reflect on the past year as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-expected-healthtech-is-the-bomb-diggity&#34;&gt;As expected, healthtech is the bomb diggity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a secret of this: Gerimedica had me at hello. Even when I joined educational technology startup Leeruniek in 2020, I knew my next stop would be healthcare technology. My expectations were grand, and I have yet to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare technology is a space of rules and regulations, intricate interfaces, dozens and dozens of personas, and policy, policy, policy. As a UX practitioner, I love getting my hands dirty with dense subject matter. Luckily, at Gerimedica I can dive in as deeply as I wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve long had a passion for technology that helps busy people spend less time with software, and the work I get to do at Gerimedica feels impactful more than anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done. There&amp;rsquo;s something deeply gratifying about seeing the effects that smart, holistic design has on people who really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autonomy-is-golden&#34;&gt;Autonomy is golden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the beauty of experience is that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to form trustworthy opinions, and at Gerimedica it&amp;rsquo;s paying off. I feel people take me seriously, respect my expertise, and actively engage my skills in a wide variety of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m the sole designer at the company, staying connected to the design community is crucial for me. I reserve a few moments each week to mentor designers through 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;ADPList&lt;/a&gt;, even bringing someone in for a one-day internship. My manager encourages this tirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tough-challenges-learners-mindsets&#34;&gt;Tough challenges, learner&amp;rsquo;s mindsets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a good puzzle, and luckily, I get to spend every day at work finding ways to solve them. There are puzzles that are more design-technical in nature, puzzles around interaction design, and many puzzles on the front of social dynamics and UX maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Gerimedica such a good employer for my particular kind of person, is that our leaders rally behind the same purpose, both in terms of product vision and company culture. They make tools available that help us all behave congruently with these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-agile&#34;&gt;What is agile?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going on 20 years in IT, which, pfffff. The longer I&amp;rsquo;m here, the easier it is to see that agile and Scrum, like the American Constitution, are matters of aspiration. That&amp;rsquo;s not a dig at my employer, just a general observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collaborate with two distinct groups of engineers: the Scrum teams, and the R&amp;amp;D team. The choreographies through which we turn ideas into solutions are, naturally, vastly distinct from one another. The Head of R&amp;amp;D was already a decade into an engineering career before the Agile Manifesto was ever even written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pause and think about that often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s the only person at our company who lived in a waterfall kind of world. I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a leaner engineer in my life. Collaborating with him, the R&amp;amp;D team, and our various Scrum teams is helping me look more clearly at all the times in my career when the statement &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re agile&amp;rdquo; became a whole new type of waterfall in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-of-feedback&#34;&gt;The value of feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a UX team-of-one, I’m fairly free in the way I lay out my own growth path at the company. These past few months, I asked a dozen people for feedback on my productivity, demeanor, and position at the company. Here are some highlights from the valuable feedback I received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-deep-listener-a-critical-thinker-a-bridge-between-teams-a-champion-of-user-centered-design-positive-fun-transparent-fast-honest-enthusiastic&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A deep listener, a critical thinker, a bridge between teams, a champion of user-centered design. Positive, fun, transparent, fast, honest, enthusiastic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My central takeaway from the feedback is that the type of person I am helps me meet people where they are. This is perhaps the most important reality of my career. Where I may sometimes 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2024/04/06/introducing-this-i-do-know/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;wonder whether I know anything at all&lt;/a&gt;, it seems I&amp;rsquo;m flying solo in that delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;you-should-take-up-more-space-give-me-your-insights-and-expertise-take-a-firm-stance&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should take up more space: give me your insights and expertise, take a firm stance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other onboarding I&amp;rsquo;ve done, I started my time at Gerimedica by keeping my mouth shut. Designers are like plumbers, often tearing down the work of the one who came before them. I consider it a sign of maturity when someone can come in and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; satisfy that urge. It&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that my coworkers are ready for a little more pushback. Don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-ahead&#34;&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 and beyond has wonderful things in store for the company, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be along for the ride. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to continuously shape effective collaboration across teams. I hit that sweet spot of a perfect design hand-off every now and then, though mostly I find that, like happiness, it&amp;rsquo;s not a permanent state, but in constant flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking full advantage of any free moment to better understand the domain in which I find myself. Getting to know healthcare professionals and what they need in their day-to-day work is an absolutely pleasure. Here&amp;rsquo;s to another year of learning, falling, getting up, and telling people a little more often that their solution is not a UX best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

            Introducing This I Do Know

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it one of God&amp;rsquo;s cruelest jokes, Manuele, our ability to feel imposter syndrome? When I read 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://manuelmoreale.com/why-i-don-t-write-dev-posts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;your post&lt;/a&gt; — late, obviously, because RSS feeds and I will never quite be best friends — I was struck by your openness on the matter. You feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t know shit. Samesies! I suppose most of us suffer from imposter syndrome every now and then, even the famous ones to whom we compare ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/220406-each-time-i-write-a-book-every-time-i-face&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have written eleven books, but each time I think, &amp;lsquo;Uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find me out.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a self-taught designer, I never walk far without experiencing imposter syndrome. And don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started on web development&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been building websites since I was 11, but I never fail to find a reason to condescend to myself about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we help each other battle our imposter syndrome? I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by IndieWeb Carnival, which is growing to be a delightful way for the community to engage. I would like to introduce This I Do Know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work or participate in a particular field, but you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you have the authority to speak on anything related to it, you may be suffering from imposter syndrome. &lt;em&gt;This I Do Know&lt;/em&gt; is a tag that may be used by anyone fighting theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify an area that activates your imposter syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one thing you know about it, big or small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write about it as though you were engaging a peer who knows nothing on the matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the fact that, while you know this thing, you still have many questions; make sure to work these questions into your writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish your post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/hello&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Tell me about it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant as a gateway to thought leadership. I personally believe that the tech industry is rife with people who equate professional growth with thought leadership, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s something harmful and boring about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a simple, small thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll learn that nobody cares about this exercise as a way of reducing their imposter syndrome. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who even experiences it. Doubt it. If you do find it helpful, 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/hello&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time in my life when someone asked me if I was experiencing menopause. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the only explanation I can give for why you might be tired.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like when products become so popular they can actually say something about society, even if what they say is something horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

            Accessibility on the small web

        <description>&lt;p&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The March edition of the IndieWeb Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is about accessibility on the small web. The host, 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.basementcommunity.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;orchids&lt;/a&gt;, touches on a note-worthy design pattern found in this fine corner of the Internet: that of artsy, personal websites that emulate technology of old, particularly the early days of Internet. The fair question orchids poses is: how does this design pattern affect people with particular accessibility needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always say that I like returning from church with more questions than I brought in. The same is true for this month&amp;rsquo;s prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a User Experience designer of digital products and software, my 17 years in the industry tells me accessibility is hot these days. Back in the day, before we ever even began to make things that were &lt;em&gt;responsive&lt;/em&gt;, I hardly ever thought about the concerns and needs of people living with blindness, color blindness, deafness, or another disability.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now, and rightfully so, many of us raise an eyebrow when we encounter online spaces that do not take into account such needs. The revolution and evolution of activism is wearing off on us, luckily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my line of work, the chances of encountering users who have considerable accessibility needs are very slim, smaller than if I were working in a business-to-consumer environment. Because of this, I like to pay attention to accessibility in my personal endeavors. It&amp;rsquo;s my way of better understanding what design today constitutes, and I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m simply a person who enjoys inclusion. Y&amp;rsquo;all means all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On zinzy.website, accessibility is a journey. There are some things I take care of naturally, such as a proper HTML document structure. Other things, like always making sure there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text available for imagery, are a work in progress. I sometimes struggle with the fact that I have to do a manual audit of each of the pages on my website to check it for accessibility. I suppose I like a good Google Chrome extension. In 2024, one of my goals is to work through the WCAG guidelines and see how far I get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to form a strong opinion on small websites using the aforementioned design pattern. My initial response is always this: do the makers of these websites not care about the accessibility of their content? I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who believe that 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/tools-do-not-matter&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;tools do not matter&lt;/a&gt;. Whether I use TextEdit, Word, Pages, nvAlt, Evernote, SimpleNote, Notion, Roam, or Obsidian, my writing should be able to travel with me without the export button being standard travel fare. That&amp;rsquo;s why almost&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; everything I write lives in a text file using Markdown syntax, and why I don&amp;rsquo;t use Notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does tool agnosticism not matter to people making artsy websites? That is simply not the right question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right questions are these. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between a content-centered website, and one where form is content, where non-words carry much of the intended meaning? How do people with disabilities navigate a web in which &amp;ldquo;form is content&amp;rdquo; is an artful, relevant way of conveying information, ideas, and emotions? What can we learn from the working definition of the word &amp;ldquo;accessibility&amp;rdquo; as it has been adopted by the art world, the world of music, cinema? Do these worlds call it that? If RSS is a means of extracting from a content-centered website what is most important, what would one use to extract the same from an artsy one? What&amp;rsquo;s digital art? What&amp;rsquo;s a website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the word &amp;ldquo;disability&amp;rdquo; not derogatorily, but because using any other word makes me feel I&amp;rsquo;m reducing the experiences of people to something smaller than they actually are.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things I have to Google Workspace or the Atlassian cloud.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay wow they filled half the cup with chocolate syrup. The only proper way to convey what the experience of a single sip was like, was to say it felt like being fucked in the mouth by a chocolate Easter egg.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The baristas at Starbucks are jokingly delegating my order to one another, puzzled by what it means to pour a cappuccino that&amp;rsquo;s half cow&amp;rsquo;s milk, half chocolate milk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As always, spending time with Annelie Wambeek is effortless. She taught Anja and I how to cook a few Sri Lankan dishes. I love it when non-spicy spices come together to give me a zinger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by what&amp;rsquo;s happening here. When I saw Sydney&amp;rsquo;s red carpet look I thought of Billie Eilish&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; as a bombshell. I wonder if a part of me is offended. I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I don&amp;rsquo;t, by the way, think it&amp;rsquo;s crazy that those far right articles celebrating Sydney&amp;rsquo;s outfit as the end of woke were written by women.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After having set up my content management system around an Obsidian vault through which I publish content at a fixed daily time, I&amp;rsquo;m reverting back to iOS shortcuts. It&amp;rsquo;s more fun to publish immediately; it helps me capture the small things more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

            Terms of inclusion, short and long
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2024/03/08/terms-of-inclusion-short-and-long/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/03/08/terms-of-inclusion-short-and-long/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My coworker Mattia is a gem; a man of deep thought and good ideas. He asked me today if I knew of any writing on the topic of language learning and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trait common in Dutch speakers (at least in the Randstad) is that, as soon as a non-native speaker joins the conversation, they will switch to English. I can speak only for myself: it&amp;rsquo;s an act of inclusion, of liberation. I want expats to feel at home in the Netherlands, and autonomous in their manner and pace of learning Dutch. Forcing them into it over lunch, which is a time to relax, is not something I&amp;rsquo;m fond of doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattia reminded me today that, while it&amp;rsquo;s an act of short-term inclusion, it&amp;rsquo;s also an act of long-term exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If expats don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to practice Dutch with, specifically to practice Dutch work talk, they may never feel comfortable enough to communicate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I not make an effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself it&amp;rsquo;s because I studied linguistics and tutored children for so long that speaking Dutch as a form of teaching doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m on a lunch break. I tell myself I can&amp;rsquo;t recalibrate my relationships with people from one language into another. That my neurodivergence makes conversations too slow-paced as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t think those reasons matter, really. I think it just makes me uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

            The surfer

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The surfer, she tells me she met a woman at a 40s singles mixer. The type of woman who reschedules her flight home to Colorado so that they can have sushi in California. There&amp;rsquo;s a sweetness to tales of the dating world when I&amp;rsquo;m in a monogamous relationship. I feel only a little bad about appropriating them to satisfy something which I can&amp;rsquo;t put into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the world in which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t spotted the surfer in the queer Catholic Slack space of 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://vineandfig.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Vine &amp;amp; Fig&lt;/a&gt; when I did, that one day she was there. I have no right to define the surfer&amp;rsquo;s hardship. The day her parents kicked her out because she&amp;rsquo;s queer. The way she seeks to remain a parishioner in a space that can&amp;rsquo;t hold both her and the woman she loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s love yet. We&amp;rsquo;ll know after sushi and maybe more. I think we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here if everything good and bad hadn&amp;rsquo;t happened to both of us, but that&amp;rsquo;s my private opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tells me about Pema Chödrön and how inspiring it is to read &lt;em&gt;Comfortable with Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;. We ask each other what it means to stand in adversity with somebody. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a person who gets this part of me better than the surfer. The steady rhythm of finding, questioning, and returning to the stories of Jesus, the stories of our spiritualities. Walking around them, considering what they mean for us, rejecting their face-value offerings to make space for depth. We are vastly different, but there&amp;rsquo;s a homecoming with the surfer that I don&amp;rsquo;t find with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we talk about what it would be like if were in the same place. Me in Newport Beach, she in Amsterdam. In some of these stories, the dogs are there, in others we meet each other at church. There&amp;rsquo;s always food involved, and warmth, warmth, warmth. It is vibrant, the friendship we have built, and I lack nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After adding myself to App Defaults I took the liberty of importing the available list of RSS feeds into my reader. It was a mistake. I spent the weekend pruning my subscriptions, hoping I won&amp;rsquo;t be presented with 200+ updates a day in the form of micro blog content. A few of the new feeds immediately struck my fancy, though, among which was

It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see the African diaspora represented somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just about any app can read it, a year and a decade from now, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, and then some. That&amp;rsquo;s more than you can say about diary apps and services, they could suddenly disappear, like the Ello social network did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at that, I had completely forgotten about Ello, but I felt its obscure echo when I read about

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Enjoying a cozy Sunday indoors with Lemonade. We took a long walk in the park, where we met Sammie, Maat, and Hovis and Norman. I can tell she&amp;rsquo;s becoming a little less responsive to my cues, which tells me she&amp;rsquo;ll be going into heat soon. I&amp;rsquo;m meeting Erin before Church. I gave myself a nice two-strand twist for the first time. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; I tell ya, I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself I need to write better 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/week_note&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;week notes&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Better&amp;rdquo; refers to their frequency and to a lesser extent to their content. I never seemed to have found the pace to spend my Sunday afternoons sipping tea and reflecting on the week gone by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just noticed in my RSS feed that 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://rachsmith.com/mnnm-1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Rach Smith&lt;/a&gt; is adopting a new habit of writing 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Dave Rupert-inspired&lt;/a&gt; month notes. I thought about my week notes, and immediately heard the voice of my wise mother-in-law saying &amp;ldquo;why suffer?&amp;rdquo; And why suffer indeed? Today, I&amp;rsquo;m writing my very first Vibe Check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happens-to-my-week-notes&#34;&gt;What happens to my week notes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep writing them, just privately so. There are great benefits to reflecting on the week, and some of those benefits can be reaped only when I write about things I can&amp;rsquo;t share publicly. An example of what I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the week notes for: reflecting more closely on mental health as well as work-related goals and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery, the halfway point.&lt;/strong&gt; If you know me personally, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;m recovering from a persistent health concern. It&amp;rsquo;s one that lingers in the background, popping up as a coping mechanism whenever it thinks it&amp;rsquo;s required. When I&amp;rsquo;m in the thick of it, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come. January proved to be a reminder of where I am in this journey. As Anja frequently sings as a form of praise: &amp;ldquo;this is what recovery looks like&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a crazy church lady, and leaning into it.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel thankful that I get to help make 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://allsaintsamsterdam.church/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;All Saints Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; the church I want and need to be a part of. As the weeks go by, a community slowly begins to form. People who return again and again, for the Eucharist, for Bible study, for coffee and intimate conversation. It has me rethinking what Church actually means to me. Much of my exposure with it has been fairly formal. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m a part of services that take place in a living room, where &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; get to give the host to my neighbor, where I read from the Bible aloud almost every time I&amp;rsquo;m there. Something is happening here, and I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased I get to be a part of it. If you&amp;rsquo;re in Amsterdam, come on over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various international friends came to visit us. My heart overflows.&lt;/strong&gt; 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zinzy.website/2024/01/31/flutter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Anneli spent a long weekend with us&lt;/a&gt;, and the Flores Boys came from Texas to explore the city and share delicious cheese platters with us at Abraham Kef. There&amp;rsquo;s something special about hugging people you normal only see on the Internet. There is such warmth in all of these relationships, as well as immediate depth, closeness, and realness. I love, &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I dipped my toes in at Omek, a community for the Black diaspora.&lt;/strong&gt; So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve already met three amazing people one-on-one, outside of the wonderful events they offer. I&amp;rsquo;ve given myself the assignment to engage more, much more, with Black people in all aspects of my life, and Omek is a lovely starting point to help me on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;work&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is great. As a newly-established UX team-of-one I&amp;rsquo;m taking a fresh look at productivity, deliverables, and the general position of UX within the product department. As always, I work to unblock development teams as fast as possible, so I have room to explore, learn, doodle, play, and grow. We&amp;rsquo;re working on some pretty cool broad-scope stuff right now, which has me working with various stakeholders to whom I usually have limited exposure. They&amp;rsquo;re awesome people in their own right, and I can learn a lot from their perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work soundtrack:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-im-consuming&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m consuming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m watching good crime and bad garbage.&lt;/strong&gt;
There is a disgruntled woman who is 37 weeks pregnant, homeless, and a &amp;ldquo;targeted individual&amp;rdquo; of social injustice. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop looking at her. It&amp;rsquo;s either her, or &lt;em&gt;Sword and Scale&lt;/em&gt;, which is great true crime, but I wonder: how much torture must I consume for entertainment purposes before it becomes suspicious? Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Berlin&lt;/em&gt;, and season 4 of &lt;em&gt;True Detective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading more than I have since I graduated in literary criticism.&lt;/strong&gt; I added a reading challenge to my Goodreads account, and so far so good! I believe I&amp;rsquo;m three books ahead of schedule. I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot and, again, seeking out Black voices in particular. The effect: as simple as less social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m exploring a daily Bible reading practice.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a suggestion Mpho made after I shared that I struggle to read the text in the discomfort of not knowing what it means. So far so good, although I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instrumental lofi music is great for work and doggo.&lt;/strong&gt; Other than that, my most popular track was Marc Rebillet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 -3100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2024/01/31/flutter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a weekend-long dance workshop in town. While she&amp;rsquo;s certainly not our first house guest, the situation feels brand new. It must be the Japanese mattress we just bought, which turns our one-bedroom shoebox of an apartment into a temporary bed and breakfast (and lunch and dinner) for Anneli, the journalist from Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her in years. The most vibrant memory I have of her is ending a three-day stay at her welcoming, warm house, and saying to Anja: &amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to quit drinking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 2100 days sober today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is, as soon as I see her face, the flutter. She waves at me through the living room window as I finish up the last bit of work. Between Anja and myself, I&amp;rsquo;m the lucky one: I&amp;rsquo;m working from home today, which affords me the luxury of treating Anneli to a lazy lunch. There will be cheese. Mountains of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter into Anneli&amp;rsquo;s presence is to soften the senses. The way you run loudly across a hallway only to stop in your tracks as soon as you see the baby, sleeping quietly in the next room. Anneli shapes conversations like a potter, I think, marveling at how she moulds a safe space out of nothing. The flutter, and it makes me want to lay my head down and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, the flutter is entirely reciprocal, because whatever I feel she brings into my world, she apparently feels I bring into hers. In the evenings, she, Anja, and I talk and talk and talk, about love, kids, Israel, the war, the war, about eros, loss, mating in captivity, the skin on our heads, about coming into our bodies. Effortlessly, the flutter. The gesture of every thing momentarily falling into place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;Better%20Call%20Saul%20%282015-2022%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Better Call Saul (2015-2022)&lt;/a&gt;. Midway through season 3, it&amp;rsquo;s finally beginning to get a firm grip on our attention span again. I loved the debut of Gus Fring, the way he lingers in the background, out of focus, voiceless, before &lt;em&gt;landing&lt;/em&gt;, so to speak. I find this one of the finest roles in television history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less reading this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggling with discernment this week: what do I do when following Jesus when it gets hard interferes with my boundaries and sense of safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beaming at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beaming at home&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;Omek.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Omek&lt;/a&gt; and was inspired by his relationship to money. He gave me great tips and a few resources to boot. I aim to make 2024 the year in which I learn to be more comfortable in my relationship with money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday continued at Bar Buka, where I met Erin for a drink. She, in an act of bravery the level of which I will never possess, left her Canta unlocked. I was able to open the door and take out the keys. I admire people who have such faith in the city of Amsterdam and the people who inhabit her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erin and I eventually made it to church, which was surprisingly full. I met Rev. Jacque Williams, who is apparently

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for providing a quick summary of Cal&amp;rsquo;s video. Saved me a watch. At first glance, his idea resonates immediately, particularly the concept of the infinite buffer. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to get lost trying to distinguish this buffer from the cybernetic tools we use to populate it.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 2: Omek

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marked the week I got back into the swing of things at work. I tend to find the holiday season quite boring because things slow down quite a bit. Now that people are returning from their winter break, my to do list is filling up again with exciting projects, opportunities for collaboration, and research endeavors. As usual, a conversation with my manager reminded me how much I love my job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished Angela Davis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Freedom%20Is%20A%20Constant%20Struggle%20%282015%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and read a few chapters of &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Out%20There%20Screaming,%20An%20Anthology%20of%20New%20Black%20Horror%20%282023%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Out There Screaming, An Anthology of New Black Horror (2023)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I had forgotten how much I love gothic horror. Echoes of Carmen Maria Machado&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Her%20Body%20and%20Other%20Parties%20%282017%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Her Body and Other Parties (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were in my head as a result all week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also began reading 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Saving%20Jesus%20From%20the%20Church%20%282009%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)&lt;/a&gt; again after first picking it up last Summer. It&amp;rsquo;s a special book, one I&amp;rsquo;ll return to again and again I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, my Wednesdays at the office varied from busy to overwhelming: lots of interactions, many meetings, few moments to myself. By the time Bible study came around at 6:30, I was ready for bed. The Wednesday this week was radically different: I had very few meetings, got to concentrate on my task list, and I attended my first 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Omek.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Omek&lt;/a&gt; accountability circle event. I found Omek, a community for people from the African diaspora, in the Autumn of 2023, and immediately considered it too good to be true. I found out this week that it isn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a community of Black people from all over the world, all professionals at various stages in their career, and many of them live in Amsterdam. The accountability circle had me eat a desk lunch. &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; check off a large portion of what I had been looking to accomplish during the entire week. Awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our dear friend AR from Stockholm came to stay at our place because she was attended a weekend-long dance workshop in Amsterdam. Five minutes with her and I remember there&amp;rsquo;s an entire portion of myself that I don&amp;rsquo;t tap into enough. Our conversations flow flawlessly, as if the last time we spoke wasn&amp;rsquo;t three years ago. I appreciate the depth we so easily reach, the air that I feel around myself, my relationships, my choices. We spend three evenings over candlelight, talking about work, family, love, trust, faith, Judaism, the war, and so much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another great thing about Wednesday was that I had the energy to attend Bible study, which started out small with the usual suspects, and became something different altogether when two other queer people of color showed up. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize there was only one straight person at the table until later. It was a very sweet experience to hear about their journeys. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll see them again. We talked about the part in John when 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John&amp;#43;1%3A42-51&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Jesus calls Philip and Nathanael&lt;/a&gt; and it made me think about feeling seen, wholly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, I had the good fortune of meeting NB, a person I met at Omek. Over chicken and waffles we got to meet each other and it felt like we were old friends. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;spectacular&lt;/em&gt; to hear about the experiences of a Black person who grew up in a white environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice IndieWeb discovery this week:

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lemonade and I have reached the stage of dog-human relationship where we trust each other, and I confidently let her off leash at the park. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better way to start the year.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 1: Miracle mornings

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&amp;rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I seem to have found my way back to the 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Miracle%20morning.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Miracle morning&lt;/a&gt; method. While I cringe at the very notion of self development, it has been great to start my day in quietude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemonade did really well on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, and while I think she would&amp;rsquo;ve been fine sleeping in her crate in the loving room, we let her sleep on the bed. We&amp;rsquo;re now people whose dog sleeps on their bed. Another benefit to this, besides cuddles, is that it gives me the living room to wake up calmly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent my winter break walking serious distances in the city, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m back to work the rush of my calendar (even when it was mostly empty this week) made it so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go on a single urban hike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a bigger effort to practice the 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Law%20of%20Two%20Feet.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Law of Two Feet&lt;/a&gt;, and much to my amusement it gives me so much more headspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re continuing our &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Better%20Call%20Saul%20%282015-2022%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Better Call Saul (2015-2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; journey, which, mid-way through season 2, seems to find itself in a bit of a legal lull. I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;ll change. I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;ll continue watching if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set a reading challenge on Goodreads this year, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m already down 1, 25 more to go. I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that non-fiction audio books work well for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday, we had farewell drinks for AN. I&amp;rsquo;m quite sad to see him go. He and I both have golden retriever energy, and it was always a bit of a homecoming to be at the office with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, I went to Coppenhagen for new beads. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for excuses to make more rosaries, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;ll make one for each liturgical color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I edit my biography in a community app for Black professionals. Other people use the flags of their heritage, and I decide to do the same. Which one goes first, 🇳🇱 or 🇸🇹? I was born in the Netherlands, and consider myself not Dutch per se but definitely an Amsterdammer. Truth be told, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to São Tomé and Principe, and the parent who hails from there left when he was ten. I wonder, brushing my teeth before bedtime, whether it&amp;rsquo;s appropriation for me to use the flag. And then I think of all the brown and Black faces I know, doing just the same, and entirely dignified and correct in doing what they do. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the prices of growing up Black in a white environment: I wonder when I&amp;rsquo;ll stop feeling like &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m&lt;/em&gt; the racist.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Make Me Think&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Design of Everyday Things&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People&lt;/em&gt; are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-design-books-guide&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://start.uxdesign.cc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;The Guide to Design&lt;/a&gt; by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Foundry has a nice overview of

&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;UX Research Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; by UserInterviews.com. It focuses purely on research practice, but it&amp;rsquo;s a comprehensive overview of all things involved in focusing on the U in UX.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by the amount of tourists who came to celebrate New Year&amp;rsquo;s in Amsterdam, as well as by their shared urge to leave the country on January 1.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t be the first one to see Jonathan Banks&amp;rsquo; character Mike in the &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; universe is strongly reminiscent of Kevin Spacey&amp;rsquo;s Lester in &lt;em&gt;American Beauty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve is sweet. I spent the morning at Coffee Company Oosterdok working on my website. The girl barista and the guy who came to take over her shift are apparently dating. He&amp;rsquo;s got a full mullet and a geeky mustache. It&amp;rsquo;s that season of fashion again. He was the type of soft masculine only Gen Z-ers can be. At 36, I seem to be developing a habit of noticing how much I&amp;rsquo;m no longer an 18-year-old. Everyone who seems my age addresses me with the formal &amp;ldquo;u&amp;rdquo;. I also saw S in the street. It&amp;rsquo;s the first anniversary of her father&amp;rsquo;s passing and she was wondering out loud what could properly trigger an ugly cry. She offered me a red velvet &amp;ldquo;oliebol&amp;rdquo;, which looked like a fried dog treat. No thank you, ma&amp;rsquo;am. A friendly face in the neighborhood knocks on our window and tells me she has enjoyed getting to know us a little more, and that she hopes to be in touch more in 2024. 6pm and pizzas enter the oven. It took only 15 minutes for us to finally get into &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;. I expect I won&amp;rsquo;t even make it until midnight. Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

            Annual review at 36

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could&amp;rsquo;ve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say &amp;ldquo;adult&amp;rdquo; but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading

            A lifetime without representation
          
        </title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 -2000</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/12/20/a-lifetime-without-representation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it&amp;rsquo;s like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He&amp;rsquo;s the person who was so discombobulated by 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26029077&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Dutch white innocence&lt;/a&gt;, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He&amp;rsquo;s doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive. He even joined a theatre group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remember when you scolded me because my website was in Times New Roman?&amp;rdquo; I ask him. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Back when this happened, he was working a Dutch corporate job. Part of him, or perhaps all of him, must have been so embarrassed to learn he&amp;rsquo;d sent his UX-hopeful coworker to a webpage that looked like it never left the late nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh look, another book on personal branding&amp;rdquo; I say as we walk into American Book Center. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s actually really what I need&amp;rdquo; he says. It&amp;rsquo;s because he&amp;rsquo;s hoping to be invited to SoHo House Amsterdam. &amp;ldquo;That reminds me of, what&amp;rsquo;s her name&amp;hellip; Anna Delvey?&amp;rdquo; I say. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it is, he tells me. It&amp;rsquo;s a private place for selected Amsterdam creatives. A country club in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s great. You can&amp;rsquo;t take pictures in there, they let you connect with other creatives, and it&amp;rsquo;s 200 euros a month. My friend rebranded herself in such a brilliant way, check out this picture of her with her paintings on Instagram. She got an invite right away.&amp;rdquo; When I note that he moved a five-hour plane ride away from SoHo House Spuistraat, he seems surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Coffee Company, he shows me his blog, but he holds his hand over the title, of which I manage to catch a glimpse. It&amp;rsquo;s such a weird name I forget it instantly, but the writing is beautiful. I&amp;rsquo;m saddened by Gen Z&amp;rsquo;s inability to just use their own bleeding name for stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the fragmentation is doing them any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I peer pressure him into getting one of those silly hand treatments at Lush, where the people always seem a little too eager to greet you. The person giving the treatment has a pronoun button on their apron, but still I get it wrong. &amp;ldquo;Zinzy, her pronouns are they/them&amp;rdquo; my friend says. Minutes later, I joke how I need an applause for managing to use the correct pronoun. The two most oppressed people on Kalverstraat, and we&amp;rsquo;re mere inches away from becoming the boomers we avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally land at Bar Bario, where the Callaloo Hoek staff has come down with covid. What a waste of a good appetite, I think, as I Uber us Ranchi sandwiches. Like two people on a date that can&amp;rsquo;t find its pace, we take turns asking each other questions from the jar on the table. &amp;ldquo;When was the first time you felt represented by the media?&amp;rdquo; I ask him. &amp;ldquo;Never&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is your SoHo House,&amp;rdquo; I say, waving my arms feverishly at the Black pride on the walls and queer people of color at the bar. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; people are &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. He cries a little bit, but because he can&amp;rsquo;t escape the characteristics of his generation, I can&amp;rsquo;t tell if he&amp;rsquo;s faking it, method acting, or just unable to cry like a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing I&amp;rsquo;m at home in Amsterdam is getting on the tram, seeing the same conductor as a few hours ago, spotting various people whose faces I know. A city as a village, but in a non-insular way.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 47: Geert Milders

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid&#34;&gt;Covid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. Despite a 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/11/19/week-46&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;negative test&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I&amp;rsquo;m not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the week, I have cabin fever that is so intense it makes me cry in the park a little bit. On Sunday, the only thing I&amp;rsquo;m left with is a stuffy nose as well as some fatigue. God, I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t develop long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consuming&#34;&gt;Consuming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anja and I watch season two of &lt;em&gt;Somebody Somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. It makes me regain a new appreciation for Bridget Everett&amp;rsquo;s physical comedy, new sincerity, and sass. I wish she and I were friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tinkering&#34;&gt;Tinkering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make some changes to my website this week, centering a page of text with links on the homepage. Sometimes, I feel bad that I don&amp;rsquo;t take screenshots every time I change it. But I suppose my continuous redesign strategy prevents that from being realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;politics&#34;&gt;Politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the country has her very own 2016 American election result: after 20 years of being (rightfully) ridiculed as a far right party, PVV is finally the biggest, taking 37 of 150 seats in the House. Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken with are gobsmacked. Party leader Geert Wilders has become Geert Milders. A part of me is angry and sad, but a much larger part says: welcome to my world.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 46: Osama

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I&amp;rsquo;ve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing. The various spaces we saw were tailored to what life must have been like when the elderly clients were younger: a fifties barber shop, a diner-like restaurant. It was endearing. More professionally, I continue to be stunned by the working lives of people in healthcare. Having to balance tight budgets and strict schedules on the one hand and genuinely wanting the best for clients on the other is not an easy feat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems like I did pick up Covid while there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve begun watching &lt;em&gt;Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&lt;/em&gt; and I love my life. The farther I become removed from the humanities major version of myself, the easier it becomes to admit I love monster disaster stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also begun watching the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and two episodes in I understand why Anja urged me to really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; give it a try. Reese Witherspoon making out with Julianna Margulies is not the stuff of dreams I thought I needed, but here we are. Acting, storyline etc. also good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Israel-Hamas War continues to rage, which has begun to feel like a weird name for the conflict. I wonder what it means that, when I Google those words, the Wikipedia entry to which I&amp;rsquo;m directed is 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;
2023 Hamas attack on Israel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will never have first-hand experience of what it means to be a Jewish person in the world today, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a second-hand experience that has been leaving me&amp;hellip; perturbed. When people discover my partner is Jewish, the tone of the conversation shifts. Not in a pro-Palestinian way, but in the way Jenna Maroney felt the urge to touch Liz Lemon&amp;rsquo;s hand after learning that Liz had met Oprah on a flight (which, of course, turned out to be a random Black woman).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I tested negative, I did spend Friday evening and night in bed with a fever and a body that felt as though it had been hit by a truck. Anja did test positive on Sunday, and so now we&amp;rsquo;re quarantining. March 2020 all over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep thinking a lot about Osama Bin Laden. About the lack of context given by the journalist who shared parts of his &lt;em&gt;Letter to the American people&lt;/em&gt; on social media. How TikTok and X, at least for a moment, were rife with people who were barely born when 9/11 happened, proclaiming support for Bin Laden because he had pro-Palestinian things to say. About the importance of digital literacy in the classroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m ill, I bake or cook. I feel bad not doing anything and lying in bed all day, and following a recipe always seems like a good way to pass the time. This week, I made apple crumble custard &lt;em&gt;vlaai&lt;/em&gt;. You can take the girl out of Limburg (and thank God for that), but&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            The artificial borders of climate activism

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea#Criticism&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there for four reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My definition of God is &amp;ldquo;science is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Dutch carnival season&lt;/a&gt; had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman. Still, I appreciate that its most vicious context of use taints it so ferociously with antisemitism that deploying it as a vehicle for unity is a recipe for disaster. The crowd was so immense that it took hours of dancing in place before we even got started on the route. By the time we got to Museum Square, the words had already left the woman&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there just in time to watch Greta Thunberg, who had been marching with us, turning her face away from cameras to remind us of why she was there. In between her on the stage and us on the field there were three screens, each projecting her face from a distance. I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; she was there, but the crowd was too big to say anything with much certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My activist friend is one of those rare white people: privileged enough to belong to the 1% of a &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; of subgroups, yet so antiracist it brings a tear to your eye. A seeker of nuance and complexity. A political unicorn. As we stood in the longest line I had ever seen, sharing the weight of a &amp;ldquo;THE CRISIS IS NOW&amp;rdquo; banner, I said to her: &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s so&amp;hellip; White here.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; she said, mildly embarrassed it seemed, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s actually a huge problem for us that we could use some help with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the Dutch South, there was a peculiar detail to the way I engaged with other people of color. I didn&amp;rsquo;t. There was no nod in the street, no tribe to which I belonged, no &amp;ldquo;our stories of minority and loneliness resonate&amp;rdquo;. Color blindness was the tune, and we were dancing to it. After almost a decade in Amsterdam I&amp;rsquo;ve come to consider this lack of acknowledgement poor behavior. There&amp;rsquo;s not a black person in the neighborhood I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I had forgotten my life wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this, until yesterday. I counted no more than ten people of color in the crowd, and I exchanged looks with not a single one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I find myself in a sea of vast whiteness, I ask myself: &amp;ldquo;where am I, why are there no other people of color here, and should I 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love white people. 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Some of my best friends are white people.&lt;/a&gt; My &lt;em&gt;wife&lt;/em&gt; is a white person. Consider it a habit I&amp;rsquo;ve developed growing up in the Netherlands, where nothing about ethnicity is quite as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What solidifies Greta Thunberg&amp;rsquo;s identity as a Zoomer is the radical solidarity she and her contemporaries practice, seemingly without effort. Once she finally got on stage, her first act of compassion was to return the word to the Palestinian woman whose sound had been disconnected immediately after she had said the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed is what you may expect to happen when a person traumatized by an active war has to find it in herself to pick up where she left off to tell 85,000 mostly white faces how climate justice and justice for Palestine can exist on the same stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;mayhem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Greta had the mic again, she decided to keep her speech brief, much to the dismay I&amp;rsquo;m sure of all the people who felt blessed to share a moment in Amsterdam with her. Not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; brief, however, that a man couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk on stage and declare he was there for the climate and not for politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respectability politics are vile today. All I can think about is the power of the speech that could have been. The one in which a Palestinian woman addresses a vast sea of white faces who all listen intently to her talk about climate change. The way she says the words &amp;ldquo;river&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo; only when referring to natural bodies of water. The way she captivates her audience until the very end, when she pulls a Hannah Gadsby to remind us all of the hypocrisy and dangers of compartmental solidarity. The way she nods quietly to the upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respectability politics are vile today. March-induced feelings of disappointment, uninspired virtue signalling, and racism find each other. A discombobulated display of on-stage pain and the very notion of pro-Palestinian sentiment have quickly been conflated into a rhetoric with which I feel increasingly uncomfortable: that people in power decide when minorities speak about their place in the world. That, when we talk about climate justice, every other topic must give way. That, when we march for a cause that seems to predominantly attract white people, unwritten rules of radical inclusion don&amp;rsquo;t apply. I feel the climate activism community interviewed for a job with me, and as a result I want to burn its résumé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sad because there are people who think climate justice can exist outside of politics. I&amp;rsquo;m sad because so many people don&amp;rsquo;t understand that 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;the personal is political&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sad because I want to engage in climate activism, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel there&amp;rsquo;s a place for me at the table. I&amp;rsquo;m sad because, right now, climate activism feels like a Gutmensch hobby. I&amp;rsquo;m sad for all the people who can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. I&amp;rsquo;m sad for our Uncle Eli from Tel Aviv who is in and out of his bomb shelter all day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I delivered this sermon today at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;http://allsaintsamsterdam.church/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;All Saints Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, along with much of humanity, it seemed, I went to see &lt;em&gt;Barbie&lt;/em&gt;. Walking out of the theatre and forming an opinion on this intro to feminism, I renamed the film to a title which I will use again today: &amp;ldquo;Blueprints: a pamphlet against simplicity&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see all of your faces here today. I&amp;rsquo;ve met most of you before, but let me make an official introduction. My name is Zinzy, I&amp;rsquo;m 35 years old, I live in Amsterdam, and I work in the tech industry. I&amp;rsquo;m an interaction designer at a medical technology company, which is to say that I design the ways in which doctors and nurses interact with my company&amp;rsquo;s software. My job is to find out how we can improve the lives of essential workers. It involves a lot of research, empathizing, and imagining. The phrase I repeat over and over again is: &amp;ldquo;How might we&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask me how I came to have such a cool job, I always tell them about my degree in Comparative Literature, and the time I spent studying Theology. It never fails to throw them off. After all, what could be further apart than the literary canon and the abracadabra I do at work all day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, really, I just love a good story. I love looking at the ways in which we attempt to make sense of the world around us as well as the world within us. I like stories because of what they say about us. I like stories because we use them in our attempts to humanize others. The truest and sweetest opinion I have on humans is that we are storytelling animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we tell a story, we take a reality (fictional or non-fictional), weave together its most important events and actors, and have our audience look at them through the eyes of one or more entities. To tell a story is an act of selection, of extraction from the truth what we deem important. To tell a story is to curate reality. To tell a story is to shape the world. We turn something complex into vehicles for education, entertainment, action. We abstract from &lt;em&gt;what is&lt;/em&gt;, so our shared language is easy to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example. Here are two stories about Jesus. One. God has a Son who is also God, he is perfect, and we will never be as good as him, but let’s try. Two. There was a baby born in humility, who grew up to be an inspiration to billions. He was murdered because people thought he was evil, but we never forgot his name. Two stories that invoke entirely different responses. Two stories that remind us that the storyteller is the one who holds the power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the story we&amp;rsquo;re telling each other is that of Christian saints. When Mpho suggested I preach about this, my thought process brought me from Mother Teresa via &amp;ldquo;oh-oh, I am certainly going to screw this up&amp;rdquo; to the most important commandment in the tech industry: ask why before you ask how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, let me tell you what I &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; do today. I can&amp;rsquo;t do is tell you how I think reliving the stories of saints will get us into the Kingdom of Heaven. I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell you about my favorite saint, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have one. What I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is share with you what I have: questions. Questions about questions. Questions about stories. Lots and lots of questions. Today, I hold onto what I know, how to build successful technology, to wade into what I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saints. &amp;ldquo;These are the ones coming out of great tribulation&amp;rdquo; the lessons tell us. Throughout the centuries, first informally and locally, and then because Popes began restricting to themselves the right to canonize, we&amp;rsquo;ve collected hundreds upon hundreds of saints. Apostles, martyrs, confessors. Human beings who were perceived to have an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today, still, many of us find inspiration in the stories about these people. They&amp;rsquo;re exemplary models, extraordinary teachers, wonder workers. They&amp;rsquo;re intercessors through whom we pray. Their stories are designed to inspire us into devotion, into serving God day and night in God&amp;rsquo;s temple, which is the world. When I think of it, saints &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; stories. After all, we never get the full picture, just what we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen is relevant enough to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories fall perfectly in step with the rhythm of Christianity, the rhythm of the Western world. The rhythm of looking for what we could have and could be. What we don&amp;rsquo;t have, and what we are not. Yet. We live in a culture of becoming. A culture, and a religion, of harder, better, faster, stronger. A culture of progression. Saints were designed to propel us towards the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no different from the culture in which I grew up: I love progress. I love growth, I love my learner&amp;rsquo;s mentality. I love that we use the saintly canon, a set of stories we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to prioritize, to be better tomorrow than we are today. But there&amp;rsquo;s a flip side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle with saints, with how our tradition has curated, abstracted their human realities. I struggle with the fact that this is an effect of storytelling &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. I struggle with what happens when details go missing, when nuance is lost. I struggle with how, without details and nuance, we idealize as quickly as we devalue. The absence of details turn excellent &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; books into pretty ok &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; movies. It turns Mary Teresa, a sweet, charitable nun with questionable opinions on the realities of sexual violence in the Catholic church, into the pinnacle of female selflessness. It turns inhabitants of Gaza into terrorists. It turns Judaism into the root of all evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of storytelling is a sharp, double-edged sword. And I want to learn how to handle it more carefully, both as a speaker and as a listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle with how stories about saints make us compare our insides to other people&amp;rsquo;s outsides. Even the word &amp;ldquo;saint&amp;rdquo; itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily invoke an atmosphere of reaching for the attainable. I struggle with this the same way I struggle with Beyoncé, who, at 23, won her first Grammy, an age at which I took five weeks to find the best typeface for my bachelor thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle with how I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself in the saints. And I need to see myself in someone to learn from them. As a queer person of color, I am intimately familiar with what it means when I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself in people. It invokes a sense of otherness, not a sense of community and hope. Color me a Christian millennial, but I learn from &lt;em&gt;mistakes&lt;/em&gt;, not from other people&amp;rsquo;s highlight reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that, when it comes to the differences between veneration, adoration, admiration, idolatry, and worship, the Catechism of the Catholic Church will tell you I&amp;rsquo;m doing it wrong. I think that&amp;rsquo;s just her modus operandi. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m doing it wrong. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a flaw in the interaction design of how we&amp;rsquo;ve been taught to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is this: you are not enough, other people are, and you should feel inspired to be more like them. Inspired by Jesus, Mother Teresa, St. Augustine, Beyonce, Stephen Hawking, Barbie, the Barbie, the resistance fighters. I don&amp;rsquo;t need a superhuman who can show me how to become more like them. I need a lifetime of flaws to remind me how to be a better me because someone else became a better them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I will forever defend the right of a design flaw to exist. In fact, if we ignore the design flaw, we&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to make things better. We must look at the problem before we come up with a solution. We must ask why before we ask how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; we become better? And then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; might we use stories in a way that retains our individuality, our dignity, and leaves a margin for error, and room for doubt? How might we let the saints, all the names in the Bible, the very humans they were, inspire us to see ourselves in each other without concluding that we fail to imitate the blueprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might we become better co-humans so that the Kingdom of Heaven is what we refer to when we say &amp;ldquo;wow, that was a really happy moment for me&amp;rdquo;? How might we do unto others as we would have them do unto us? How might we remember that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the entire law, and the rest is just commentary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lemonade got a free treat from the pet store: a nylon bite ring with edible bits. She&amp;rsquo;s so obsessed with it that she keeps walking around with it while whining, hiding it behind curtains and doors whenever she gets the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 39: Small escapes
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/10/01/week-39-small-escapes/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all: not a great week. I continue to struggle to notice when I feel stresed or overwhelmed, and it never fails to result in my body giving me a clear sign. On Monday evening, in the midst of a busy work month, my body said &amp;ldquo;SIT. DOWN.&amp;rdquo; I needed undtil well into the weekend to feel myself again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the signs my body knows to give it a very mild version of conversion disorder: I lose the ability to listen to a conversation while I walk without feeling very dizzy. Isn&amp;rsquo;t the body a beautiful, very annoying, but magnificent thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start back up at work on Thursday, working the mornings until the weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s good to acknowledge things aren&amp;rsquo;t great., It brings clarity and rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday evening 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/09/30/film-club-s01e01&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;I attend the first edition&lt;/a&gt; of a new local film club I joined. It confirms what I already know: I love the horror genre, and I love discussing cinema with people who didn&amp;rsquo;t finish film school Anja I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ever since we 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/08/17/norway-et-al&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;visited Hija de Sanchez in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; Anja and I have gotten really into Mexican food. By now, I&amp;rsquo;m so well-versed in the art of a simple-but-sublime taco, that I whip up a delicious meal. Who knew tacos required so little filling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, I visit Micropia, a zoo-adjacent museum about microbes. I expect to be queasy throughout the entire visit, terrified by the unfortunate-looking mini animals that live in and on every part of my body. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed by the beauty of nature. During the mini class I ask a question about algae: if their bodies move towards light and they&amp;rsquo;re under a microscope for a while, where light comes from all sides, what happens to their health? The laboratory assistant tells me the museum swaps petri dishes regularly so that the algea don&amp;rsquo;t die. What happens before death, though, I wonder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Sunday, Chenelva comes over for afternoon drinks. She&amp;rsquo;s one of those rare people: an instant connection and plenty of common ground to grow out friendship on. We marvel at how little we know about queer BIPOC Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve completed the first season of the Dutch reality show &amp;ldquo;B&amp;amp;B vol liefde&amp;rdquo;, in which B&amp;amp;B owners invite four dates into their home. Hate-watching reality television with Anja is one of my favorite pastimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I attended the very first gathering of FC de Filmfanaten, a brand-new film club that my friend Jolien started. There were four of us, and we discussed the movie I was proud to have suggested: &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Talk%20To%20Me.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Talk To Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I love speaking about films with others, and particularly with this diverse group of people. Everyone brought a completely unique perspective to the film, one brought film industry insights while the other had thoughtful ideas that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the notes I took (in Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just came home from the first edition of a new, invite-only film club, FC de Filmfanaten. I had suggested the film, &amp;ldquo;Talk To Me&amp;rdquo;, and I loved getting fresh perspectives and tidbits on it.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 37: Rosh Hashanah
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/09/17/week-37-rosh-hashanah/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 08:49:15 -1700</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/09/17/week-37-rosh-hashanah/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this the sky is gray and it&amp;rsquo;s raining, but this week&amp;rsquo;s weather was cheerful and moderate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to call her my friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://manuelmoreale.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;People &amp;amp; Blogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is off to a good start. To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people&amp;rsquo;s websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to inviting them to our place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja&amp;rsquo;s bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like modular living, and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling less and less awkward about the way we&amp;rsquo;re going about it in our house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After visiting Anja&amp;rsquo;s mom in the afternoon, we biked to Kriterion to Watch &lt;em&gt;Oppenheimer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much like the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;m not in the best of states. There&amp;rsquo;s an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I&amp;rsquo;m slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m nearing the end of my journal, and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past, 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20680004/notebook-journal-finish-strategies&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;like the rest of the world, as it appears&lt;/a&gt;, I had trouble finishing a journal in a relaxed manner. Looking at the first entry, I see I have 29 days left until it&amp;rsquo;ll have been one year exactly. Hello nerves.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can&amp;rsquo;t keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more excited to welcome my 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://vineandfig.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Vine &amp;amp; Fig friends&lt;/a&gt; Pickles and Patrick to the city. They&amp;rsquo;re two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick&amp;rsquo;s husband, couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined the V&amp;amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to

&lt;li&gt;On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at

It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say &amp;ldquo;momma&amp;rdquo;. I want to make my own cheese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After dinner at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://thuskomme.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Thuskomme&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it&amp;rsquo;s nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. One minute we&amp;rsquo;re talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I&amp;rsquo;ve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it&amp;rsquo;s becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop&amp;rsquo;s garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love it when I&amp;rsquo;m in the store and a kid is trying to sell their parent on the idea of buying them some tchotchke. &amp;ldquo;Ah, wow, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;moisturizing&lt;/em&gt;! Interesting, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually take a while to overcome the cringe I feel about my past selves, but why wait when I can laugh joyfully right now at Anja and myself less than a month ago, passing the Swedish city of Göteborg and thinking the printing press was invented there?&lt;/p&gt;

            Two things true
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/09/06/two-things-true/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/09/06/two-things-true/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend&amp;rsquo;s citizenship party and I&amp;rsquo;d call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he&amp;rsquo;s teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s when I begin to talk about tension-building&amp;rdquo; he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows &amp;ldquo;you know what moment I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, right?&amp;rdquo; I say yes but I don&amp;rsquo;t. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turns towards to his friends and continues. &amp;ldquo;I lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I&amp;rsquo;m so nervous, thinking &amp;lsquo;gosh, did I really misread all the signs?!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Apparently, then I said these words, which&amp;hellip;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he&amp;rsquo;s talking about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew cat whispers at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we&amp;rsquo;d ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who&amp;rsquo;s on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops. I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 34: Somerlust

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/08/27/week-34-somerlust/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Tim%20Bleeker.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Tim Bleeker&lt;/a&gt; at 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Somerlust%20Park.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Somerlust Park&lt;/a&gt; on 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;2023-08-22.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, a get-together that started as &amp;ldquo;chilling in the park&amp;rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&amp;rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&amp;rsquo; requests. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine the type of person that would do this, and then I looked around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still seem to have a pinguecula because of 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/07/22/norway-et-al-2023/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;the time I spent in an airconditioned car not too long ago&lt;/a&gt;, although my eye is far less red than last week. I feel guilty for disgusting any reader with this information, but hey, they&amp;rsquo;re weeknotes. Long story short, I now have sunglasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Hillsong,%20A%20megachurch%20exposed.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Hillsong, A megachurch exposed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and learned a lot about how the church has propelled itself into popularity. Knowing how anti-queer the church has always been, I never felt comfortable attending a service in Amsterdam. The early 10s fashion made me feel nostalgic, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a lovely workshop at work about effective team work. It was inspiring, educational, and great for a sense of collaboration, not just with my peers, but also with the company&amp;rsquo;s leadership. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to be a part of a company that walks its talk so enthusiastically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to be a good dog mom to Lemonade, seeing Anja&amp;rsquo;s conduct and training as much more effective and kind. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to praise her good behavior more than I punish her mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was off on 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;2023-08-25.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and I went to an early-morning showing of &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Talk%20to%20Me%20%282023%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Talk to Me (2023)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely do again. A cute retired Amsterdam couple were discussing their elaborate weekend cooking plans, which I found delighting. They proceeded to talk all throughout the movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tidied 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Annelie%20Wambeek.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Annelie Wambeek&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s house now that she&amp;rsquo;s coming back from her month abroad. I brought her some eggs, bread, milk, some treats, and flowers, and I made sure to leave the house smelling fresh. I hope it makes her feel good when she comes home tonight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent Saturday and Sunday 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023-08-27-12-43-45&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;tinkering on the website&lt;/a&gt;, and feel good about the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the hunt for a good strategy for 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Bible%20study.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Bible study&lt;/a&gt; in 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Obsidian.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and I managed to find a verse-per-file translation of the 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;King%20James%20Bible.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;King James Bible&lt;/a&gt; on

It took a couple of days before the whole thing was properly synced across my devices, which I suspect might be the result of 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/112ynkj/background_sync_on_ios/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync not be able to perform background syncs&lt;/a&gt;. It made me consider switching to iCloud Sync for a second, but honestly I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered. I&amp;rsquo;m keen to see when I&amp;rsquo;ll actually begin using the 33,613 files that are taking up over 100 mb in my vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found myself missing church this week. I&amp;rsquo;m excited for 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;All%20Saints%20Amsterdam.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;All Saints Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; to start back up again mid-September. I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what&amp;rsquo;s in store for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Mark%20Delany.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Mark Delany&lt;/a&gt; came over for Lemonade cuddles and dinner on 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;2023-08-26.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. I made 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Tacos.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Tacos&lt;/a&gt;, successfully if I do say so myself, and we had a lovely time catching up and discussing what really matters: the fact that Mark uses the word &amp;ldquo;taco&amp;rdquo; as a standard synonym for female genitalia. I&amp;rsquo;m still laughing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve updated some things around here over the weekend that I think are worth documenting. There are three major changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status update at the top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content is now served through a submodule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/blogroll&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://muan.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Mu-An&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s status update so much I had to have it for myself. I like the idea of fleeting messages, blurbs shouted into space, with no proper archive. I almost fool myself into thinking nobody will be able to hold me accountable for what I publish there, but we all know that&amp;rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy writing 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Densely-linked%20content.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Densely-linked content&lt;/a&gt;, and for this reason it&amp;rsquo;s better for me to have all of my writing in a single space. My space of choice at the moment is 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Obsidian.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Github Publisher&lt;/a&gt;, an Obsidian plugin, and Tania Rascia&amp;rsquo;s 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.taniarascia.com/git-submodules-private-content/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;sweet writeup on submodules&lt;/a&gt;, I now technically don&amp;rsquo;t have to be in my code base to publish content anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taking the liberty of hacking together the most obscene of deployment strategies: every time I update my status, Netlify builds my site and checks the latest updates of the submodule, publishing any new notes, posts, or pages in the process. I am not ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been enjoying both iOS apps Dwell and Abide for the way they integrated with my spiritual practice, but it&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to find out they both skipped the trial and billed me €40+.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;All the teachers around me are slowly getting nervous anticipating the start of the new school year. Anja&amp;rsquo;s taking her anger out on the pottery wheel. I can smell the freshly-sharpened pencils from here. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just the August rain, wrinkling the foreheads of sun lovers, creating warm puddles on the pavement, telling us it went by in a blink.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 33: Landing

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I&amp;rsquo;m just landing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be. On Sunday, I go for a long bike ride to Amsterdamse Bos and back, and crossing the Berlagebrug I&amp;rsquo;m struck by how quiet the street is without cars racing by. I like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished watching &lt;em&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Anja&amp;rsquo;s still off for the summer, and I&amp;rsquo;m watching her slowly recover from being my personal chauffeur for two weeks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two weeks in Scandinavia, it&amp;rsquo;s clear: we are both too Dutch for proper recycling. Secretly hoarding our trash to avoid a reprimanding from our AirBnb host as he hovers over his six-compartment recycling bin, we continue our trip from rural Sweden to Copenhagen looking for a public recycling station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imagine if we got so nervous about doing it wrong that we ended up just dumping these bags by the roadside&amp;rdquo; I say to Anja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Last Tuesday, two Dutch lesbians were found dead just outside of Lidköping after the Swedish environmental police task force shot them at point-blank range for abusing the recycling system. Their families have been notified, begrudgingly.&amp;rdquo; Anja jokes, staring off into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not &lt;em&gt;Queen &amp;amp; Slim&lt;/em&gt;, but King &amp;amp; Thicc!&amp;rdquo;, I suggest, &amp;ldquo;You can be King&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;m thicc, too&amp;rdquo;, Anja complains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, we&amp;rsquo;re home again, back from our first proper vacation in four years, and boy oh boy, did we need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan was simple: make Anja&amp;rsquo;s dream come true by renting a Tesla, drive it to Norway, do nothing there for a week, and then spend another week slowly making our way back via the Swedish countryside, and Copenhagen, where our friends live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two long, well-airconditioned days in our wonderful car we made it to Eastern Norway. In Hallingdal, one of the country&amp;rsquo;s most popular ski destinations, we found a beautiful and cozy cabin on top of a mountain, overlooking the Tisleifjorden. To our surprise, it proved the perfect getaway for people who didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s indeed exquisite, the Norwegian faith in our human ability to treat nature with respect. Quietly, it makes an enormous difference. The difference is in the shared understanding of where we leave our trash. It&amp;rsquo;s in the thousands of cabins spread out across the country,

It&amp;rsquo;s in the canoe that just lays by the water, available to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t even really have to lock your doors&amp;rdquo;, one fisherman commented while teaching his son to throw a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never kept our doors unlocked, of course. The city is embedded in our system too deeply, as were the countless &amp;ldquo;cabin in the woods&amp;rdquo; movie plots I remembered. If anything, though, it helped us pause, listen to the sound of nothing, and listen to our bodies, which were telling us to take that second nap of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, one day earlier than intended, we swiftly packed the car and drove all night to Lidköping, by Vänern, Sweden&amp;rsquo;s largest lake. While we&amp;rsquo;d been napping and relaxing, the world was reading the headlines about Storm Hans, a twice-a-century type of storm that would&amp;rsquo;ve gotten us stuck on that mountain if we hadn&amp;rsquo;t left when we did. That three hours of driving through landslide-prone mountains wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be pleasant, even in a well-heated Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clouds were low as we drove off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copenhagen, &lt;em&gt;kubnhawn&lt;/em&gt; for the in-crowd, was a lot lighter, sunnier, and safer. We stayed with Naomi, Shlomik and little Goldie. Their cute, young family, the house, and the fact that were surrounded by thousands of people everywhere we went, was everything I needed after the quiet Norwegian fjords. One day exploring the city was enough to convince me: I need to visit again.&lt;/p&gt;

            So, about this Scriptogr.am
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/08/05/so-about-this-scriptogr.am/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 10:16:15 -0500</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/08/05/so-about-this-scriptogr.am/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am notorious for never grasping how many people know how much about what. To save myself from any further embarrassment I won&amp;rsquo;t spend my time here telling you what the app is about. The team does that nicely over here. I do think I have something to say about what Scriptogr.am came exactly at the right time for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we more further down the line of Web 2.0 and slowly into the abyss that is Web 3.0, I feel the definitions of web design are evolving greatly. I remember back in the day when it was just one website out of fifty that looked really beautiful, and how I would spend many hours on the site just being surrounded by all the pretty. Now, as more and more distinct design trends are emerging, looking pretty isn&amp;rsquo;t the main goal anymore. It has become a criterium. And most websites I know meet that criterium in one way or another. Now that the eyes have what they need, the user wants for the website to be up to speed with their brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where websites fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all websites have the potential of being minimalist, small and clean code-wise. Pardon me if I say that the designers might know ways to get there, but experience tells me clients always manage to come up with ways to make a code more extensive than it should be. So, some of the websites I am talking about can be exempt from my suggestion. But certainly, and most of all, I am talking about the weblog. A place where, once in 1992, a HTML page and new words every now and then would suffice. We have come a long way from that simple structure. Now, with everybody tuning into Wordpress, Drupal, and Tumblr for ready-made templates and every single widget known to man, I feel I&amp;rsquo;m becoming more and more detached from simple, beautiful web design and UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scriptogr.am, to me, is a great answer. It gives me very few options: I can write, display some links, even add an image if I like, but that is as far as I am gonna go. There are no custom archives, last.fm user grids, Flickr photo streams or twenty PHP pages I can configure any way I want to. It is me, my words, a few nice web fonts, a few links, and the ease of writing from anywhere in a cloud. Scriptogr.am allows me to ask myself a question I was afraid to ask myself for a long time: why does my website need every available function? Why do blogs take up so much space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is now as much a personal space as it is a manifest and an experiment. In the upcoming weeks or months I will experience what it is like to use one app that is always with me and directly upload content to my website without having to do much beside write. I truly believe that, as a blogger (whether you are a professional or an absolute amateur like me), it is crucial to know how much effort writing a blog should take. In my opinion, it should take very little. Not only because it is simply too much work, but also because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt that keeping my blog beautiful and cool became more important than actually writing on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the playground, a dad rocks back and forth in a swing just slightly and stares into the distance while his child sits in the stroller. The parental leave coffee break.&lt;/p&gt;

            What Pride means to me in 2023

        <description>&lt;p&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/04/26/dear-nienke-you-should-have-a-website/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Nienke&lt;/a&gt;, Mehdi, an anonymous friend, and I attend the annual Pride March. It&amp;rsquo;s the city&amp;rsquo;s first 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pride.amsterdam/en/pride-foundation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term &amp;ldquo;queer&amp;rdquo;, I am pleased 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://queer-amsterdam.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Queer Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &amp;ldquo;an anonymous friend&amp;rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll wear my face mask&amp;rdquo; he says, 20 minutes into the event. &amp;ldquo;Am I getting too close?&amp;rdquo; I ask, concerned. No, he just doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable being photographed. The off chance that his parents may see him is not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk, I think about the meaning of the word &amp;ldquo;pride&amp;rdquo;. If we walk in a Pride March, can we be proud without wanting to be photographed and broadcast for anyone to see? A sign in the crowd reads &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t be what you can&amp;rsquo;t see&amp;rdquo;, and I agree. Representation is crucial, to this my life is a testament. But what burden does that place on people whose visibility is dangerous to themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of queerdom, the way it interacts with ethnicity, religion, ability, neurodivergence, age, education, and location, is why I&amp;rsquo;m here today. Why I&amp;rsquo;m here at all. Mehdi, who has never attended a Pride event in his life, learns to shout along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do we want? / TRANS RIGHTS! / When do we want them? / NOW!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeches this year spark my interest. 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pride.amsterdam/ambassadors/tieneke-sumter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Tieneke&lt;/a&gt; talks about consent, an oft-overlooked point of concern in our queer communities. Someone whose name I forgot talks about bisexuality. I remember how unsettling it was as a young adult that people told me I was &amp;ldquo;in transit&amp;rdquo;, on my way to being either gay or straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m here today shouting for myself, a little bit, but also to engage in the praxis of allyship which is by default an aspirational habit: doing the things we know to be right, without determining for other people whether we can call ourselves their allies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just spotted a family of tourists, the dad one of those Pabst Blue Ribbon hipsters who’s now adulting. He wore a shirt that read “THE SMITHS”, accompanied by a black-and-white group photo of Will Smith with his wife and kids. Thought it was deeply hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m envious of teenagers who get to record their singing voices every day if they wanted to. I have a suspicion that I’m a better singer now than I was at 15, but I have no way of confirming it.&lt;/p&gt;

            The blonde

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the shopping street&lt;br&gt;
for people who look like&lt;br&gt;
they do in the magazines&lt;br&gt;
there’s a blonde marching in place waiting&lt;br&gt;
for the light to turn green.&lt;br&gt;
She is not running per se, rather&lt;br&gt;
she’s hinting at running.&lt;br&gt;
Selling it, the way&lt;br&gt;
Charlize Theron sells&lt;br&gt;
a night to remember in a perfume commercial&lt;br&gt;
with next to nothing for evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, a tired mother,&lt;br&gt;
and a tennis player with wet hair&lt;br&gt;
stare at the blonde,&lt;br&gt;
one more covertly than&lt;br&gt;
the others.&lt;br&gt;
I know not to tilt my head&lt;br&gt;
when encounting something&lt;br&gt;
in which the world tells me&lt;br&gt;
I will never see myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many things&lt;br&gt;
that are perfect&lt;br&gt;
about the blonde that I&lt;br&gt;
get dizzy counting.&lt;br&gt;
Even a thigh gap as big as hers&lt;br&gt;
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to hold&lt;br&gt;
all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the length,&lt;br&gt;
and the waviness, and the glossiness,&lt;br&gt;
and the readiness of her hair&lt;br&gt;
are just a complete unnecessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all hate her, the blonde.&lt;br&gt;
Me, a tired mother,&lt;br&gt;
and a tennis player with wet hair.&lt;br&gt;
We hate her because&lt;br&gt;
of all the little things&lt;br&gt;
the world has denied us&lt;br&gt;
the words to articulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all hate her, the blonde,&lt;br&gt;
and the blonde hates herself&lt;br&gt;
a little, too,&lt;br&gt;
for reasons so bafflingly&lt;br&gt;
unimportant to us&lt;br&gt;
she could die from jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally we have them over to the house again, for the first time in what feels like a human life. One walks in smiling, the other bursts out in tears. “She’s pregnant” I think to myself. I’m right. For whatever godforsaken reason I see her as a submarine now. We talk without pausing, picking up from what could have been yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at a picture of Elon Musk on The Guardian, and I need to do a triple take to see the caption does not, in fact, read “Elton John”. Sometimes, I feel like I’m in a live action dyslexia test.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 27: Haven
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/07/09/week-27-haven/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0900</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/07/09/week-27-haven/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week, I attended my first Gerimedica party. It’s great to know I can expect a big celebration every year, and not just for the company’s sweet sixteen. It confirmed what I already know: great vibe, great taste, great people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to Bar Bario on Saturday for a meet-up called Hair Haven, which fosters connection between people with curly hair. Again, I was struck by how welcoming the space is. It’s a ridiculous feeling, being the norm there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m tired these days. Too much fun, too little rest. I’m better at napping, though. On Sunday, I barely wanted to get out of bed after a little snooze. Three years ago, a nap was unthinkable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m giving Reni Eddo-Lodge‘s &lt;em&gt;Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race&lt;/em&gt; another spin. The title alone makes it a hard read, but I’m hoping I’ll find myself along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Dalva&lt;/em&gt; at Ketelhuis. Reading the reviews, I’m surprised so many people seem to interpret the girl’s dress style as “an adult woman in the 50s”. I thought it was reminiscent of the way girls dressed when the camera first came out. Not a girl, not yet a woman. Regardless, I imagine being Dalva’s mother, getting to know her daughter again, and understanding what has gone so wrong in the fibers of het child. It sends chills down my spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In another childhood trauma narrative, I thought it was so moving that Jan Broberg played the therapist in the Showtime series on her turbulent childhood. I fantasized the scenes functioned as a systemic family constellation, her talking to her childhood self. The reality was probably much more technical than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anja had a very intense and short stint with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, remarking on its evocative storytelling in the Cold War portion. She finished it, though, and the zombies turned om her off with such immediacy that she’s back to NBA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After hearing it only once, Billie Eilish’s “The 30th” is stuck in my head. She and her brother have a good thing going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the inspiration, Barry! I had a separate page for snapshots, but why not move them under Notes with the other IndieWeb post types?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may want to download their 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think you may enjoy

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels cliché to phrase it like this, but I feel I witnessed a historic Keti Koti ceremony today, with a surprisingly genuine request for forgiveness by our king. It was a good year for me to finally understand my place in a holiday that’s part mine and part not. The ceremony made up for the hour-long wait in the half rain to get a sandwich for someone who had already gone home. Wan swit’ manspasi!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, someone asked if I’m Jewish, and I said “my partner’s Jewish, and because Judaism sometimes explains much better where I am theologically, I’m Jew-ish” and he said I sounded like most natural, well-rehearsed thing he has heard me say.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 26: Keti Koti
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/07/01/week-26-keti-koti/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0100</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two months of onboarding have rushed by in a blink. The new job is absolutely wonderful: the people are great, the work is complex and important, and the office itself is perhaps the finest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked at. I joined this company because the challenges they have seemed interesting to me. I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that, two months in, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to think that, at one point in time, these challenges weren&amp;rsquo;t also mine. I&amp;rsquo;ve made the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I met two friends with whom I share a special history. The time we spent together resulted in many things. One of them was the tattoo on my left arm that say &amp;ldquo;WAT ER IS&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;what is there&amp;rdquo;). Spending my evening with them, sharing a meal, shedding a few tears, reminded me of why the tattoo is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Anja and I watched Keti Koti&amp;rsquo;s 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://ketikotiamsterdam.nl/bigi-spikri-optocht/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Bigi Spikri memorial service&lt;/a&gt; on television. I truly detest that the thing we requested became such a point of contention, that finally getting it almost made us forget that what we requested was a minimum viable product. Still, King Willem Alexander offering an apology and asking for forgiveness was history in the making. As an Afropean person I&amp;rsquo;m easily erased from the Dutch narrative of Trans-Atlantic slave trade that focuses on the Netherlands and her former colonies. Mentioning us by name specifically let Willem Alexander articulate how well he has been listening these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we made our way to Museumplein for the Keti Koti festival. Upside: I got to eat cotton candy, twice, and we got to financially contribute to many great Black causes in the city. Downside: I spent way too much time in line for food with hundreds of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading! I finished a book. I have a track record of struggling to enjoy reading as a burnt-out lit major, but 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;Citizen%20%282015%29.md&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Citizen (2015)&lt;/a&gt; was easy to get through. It turns out I am enthusiast of the lyric essay genre. I picked up a book of poetry by Anton de Kom at Keti Koti, and I&amp;rsquo;m diving head-first into that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://elliott.computer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Elliott&lt;/a&gt;, so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023-06-23-14-00-00&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;June 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;rsquo;s some stuff I love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://jason.cosper.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Jason Cosper&lt;/a&gt; inspired me to get rid of my About page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://agilemanifesto.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/lean-ux-agile-study-guide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group&lt;/a&gt; has a few nice resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to extraversion and &amp;ldquo;people-person&amp;rdquo;-ness, I think the UX industry is quite a good fit for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t those things. Like I said, your ability to create an icebreaker on the fly isn&amp;rsquo;t half as interesting as your ability to figure out what UX method can answer a specific question. This reminds me of 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/719000396/65193d4f26&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;a talk I attended at UXInsights Festival 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t about this topic per se, but about making UX research accessible for neurodivergent UX professionals. You might like it!&lt;/li&gt;

As promised, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of things I wanted to share with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few IndieWeb people I like (who are involved in the community in various degrees) are

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll spend some time in the next few weeks cleaning up my site. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably also try to establish some form of digital garden again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. I check the news multiple times a day. I scoff at outlets that don&amp;rsquo;t deem it worthy of the front page. I also scoff at outlets that do. A media drama can antagonize me the way Adele disappoints me with her popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I’m part of a &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;-obsessed gaggle of netizens somehow has me convinced I&amp;rsquo;m not just procrastinating. Five men with money — sums of it — on their way to Titanic in a little titanium box, are lost at sea. To empathize, the world holds her breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up without my father, I never gave much thought to the reality in which he once found himself, well over half a century ago. Ten years old, him and his football team of siblings, on a boat, lost at sea. I wonder if the five men ever saw Titanic. I wonder if they cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine he was lost at sea the way only a child can be: cursed with the spirit of adventure. Where did the boat depart from? Did he bring a toy? Was there a tiger? The only way I can read the scene is with the poetry of someone who’ll never know what it’s like to leave home when home is the mouth of a shark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet continues her wailing. Debris is found. The 19-year-old had only tagged along to make Father’s Day one to remember. I don’t know the story about my father’s father. I never celebrated a proper Father’s Day. My father’s father was long dead before the boat was put out to sea. Yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dutch news site tells me, at the bottom in small font, about their podcast episode. Who is responsible for the boat refugees who drowned off the Greek coast? Could we leave their bodies on the ocean floor? On Reddit, people share animated maps of the football team of rescue boats circling Titanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. Like a mosquito it drowns out the other humming. Like a natural disaster it refrigerates the other stories, the puzzles I fear I will never solve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While walking to grab coffee, my colleague tells me about the peculiarities of his seventeenth-century hat making ancestors, proud of the genealogical research his dad has done. After work, I google “Trans-Atlantic slave trade”, looking to see if I can spot my father’s generic colonist surname among those who made it back to his island. I can’t, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading a book on Bijlmer Bajes (a famous Amsterdam prison), and I’m chuckling at the architect’s decision not to add bars to the windows, but instead rely on “wire alarm” in the glass. Obviously it resulted in a lot of prison breaks, but what fascinates me is that the user story changed completely from a prison guard aiming to keep a prisoner from breaking out to them aiming to be alerted to a breakout attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I found myself in line at a coffee place giving my friend a very passionate speech in response to her question &amp;ldquo;why would anyone have a website?&amp;rdquo;. I always marvel at people who don&amp;rsquo;t share this sentiment with us, James. Nice to meet you!&lt;/p&gt;

            Dear Nienke, you should have a website
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/04/26/dear-nienke-you-should-have-a-website/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -2600</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/04/26/dear-nienke-you-should-have-a-website/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I embark on a journey towards a published post about why it&amp;rsquo;s good to have a website, I get lost in the reality of personal details. Everyone has different reasons for believing something. Aiming to take them all into account doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me write anything that feels worthwhile and not like a derivative&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels much more relevant to focus my attention on specific people. In this case I&amp;rsquo;m focusing my attention on you, Nienke. I think you should have a personal website. Let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a personal website not because you need to grow an audience, and turn your hobbyist writing into a profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a personal website not because you&amp;rsquo;re an expert on some subject, and it would be cruel to deny the world your wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a personal website not because you think you&amp;rsquo;re important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a personal website not because the world is in need of your highlight reel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a personal website because I think the online world is as real as the offline world. You have a presence in one, and you should have a presence in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your personal website an online living room of sorts. The place that displays, in a variety of ways, who you are, what you care about, and how you&amp;rsquo;re moving through the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re free to invite anyone to come in, and have them see anything you deem relevant. They can stay for three seconds and walk out the door, or dwell for a bit, opening drawers, going back in time, answering questions, questioning answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that there are people on the other side of the world who would want to know how you&amp;rsquo;re doing, what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking and learning. Not because you&amp;rsquo;re you, per se, but simply because you have in common the habit of sharing your experiences in an online space where you are the boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;cozy web&lt;/em&gt; out there, where people connect simply because they enjoy snacking on each other&amp;rsquo;s slices of life: the seemingly unimportant moments, words, images that approximate what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, also, what it means when I say &amp;ldquo;you are the boss&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of how little you control about yourself on the Internet. The &lt;code&gt;.nl&lt;/code&gt; website of your name is already registered, but are you its owner? I doubt it. Your company has a portrait of you on their website, and it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, but you can&amp;rsquo;t add anything to the page it&amp;rsquo;s on, can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an updated LinkedIn page and it&amp;rsquo;s a great way for people to find you, but do you live to work or work to live? Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s LinkedIn designers who decide for you what your profile will look like. If you&amp;rsquo;d ever want to do anything other than write a post or update your experiences, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an old newsletter containing an interview with you, again with that wonderful portrait. It&amp;rsquo;s probably because of your work that this is all I can find on you. It makes me sad, Nienke, it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know why? I love learning about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. And I suspect the places where you share that are social media profiles that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily use your full name. It&amp;rsquo;s great for privacy, of course, I get it. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be on social media to stay in your loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather, I want social media to be our websites. You read mine and I read yours, we write comments on our own websites and they&amp;rsquo;re posted to each other&amp;rsquo;s websites automatically.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Twitter can fall, Instagram can crumble, LinkedIn can add an expensive subscription model, but you and I will still have our websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to take up space on the Internet, Nienke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to enjoy doing so and perhaps even making new connections in the process. I want you to learn how to build your own website and tell me in a year that it&amp;rsquo;s actually much easier than you thought. I want you to feel empowered. And to have a 






  
  
  


      
    
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/now/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; page, and to keep lists on your websites of things you love in Amsterdam and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to feel that you can escape the rat race of likes, favs, and reposts. I think what you have to say is worth more than the hipness of some platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to fall in love with personal websites so much that you write about it on your website, and tell people about it at Coffee Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you the wonderful community of random people from all over the world, who are so much more curious and enthusiastic, so genuinely supportive, and so much kinder than any of the communities I&amp;rsquo;ve ever found on Big Tech platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to read what you have to say about the world when you stop worrying what your blog should be called.&lt;/p&gt;

            Maker&#39;s marks for King&#39;s Day

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s late in the morning and I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to Gerimedica, the company&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. I&amp;rsquo;m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of calling my office. I cross the river Amstel, enjoy the sun, and marvel at the preparations people have been making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, King&amp;rsquo;s Day is upon us. It&amp;rsquo;s always a big event in the country, and specifically in Amsterdam, and this year it&amp;rsquo;s extra special: our king was coronated ten years ago this year. In our house it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal, in fact Anja couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more of an anti-monarchist if she tried. Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s too young to pay it any mind, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. But the rest of the country is getting ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King&amp;rsquo;s Day is full of traditions: young children playing the violin out of tune at the park, tompouce pastries, the king and his family on a heavily-televised trip to a Dutch city that has been preparing for this moment for a year. And forever and for always: people securing a spot on the flea market route days ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I biked across the city, I saw hundreds of them; 40 square feet of pavement taped off by people aiming to use that specific spot to spend their King&amp;rsquo;s Day. Peddling by, I thought to myself that it was a rather sweet unwritten rule: I put my name here in a manner that you could erase at any moment, but Dutch custom says you&amp;rsquo;re to honor my plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m used to people marking these spots &amp;ldquo;bezet&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;taken&amp;rdquo;) or adding their name for emphasis. Today, however, I noticed many people had made a small figure with their tape, a maker&amp;rsquo;s mark of sorts. I&amp;rsquo;m learning through Anja&amp;rsquo;s ceramics adventure that this is entirely common in the potter community: a small, minimalist figure telling the world you made something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope all those people get what they came for: that specific spot on the pavement, and a fun day to help them Konmari their house. In the meantime, I also hope that the Amsterdamse Bos is quiet on King&amp;rsquo;s Day. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to take Anja and Lemonade there for a quiet afternoon, far away from the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Enjoying Sunday night dinner with Anja and my father-in-law. As of recent, we’ve been experimenting with taking it down a notch, food-wise. Rather than wowing guests with eight hours of cooking time, we now feel much more comfortable cooking a few dishing and ordering stuff we love. Today, our Middle Eastern menu was complemented by dishes from D&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One skill I’m pleased to have been cultivating these past few years is giving myself a permission slip to rest. I just woke up from a two-hour nap and boy, the world is a new place. Anja clearly remembers the dragon I would turn into whenever I was in need of a nap or just waking up from one. As though I would need to punish myself for having taking a break. Now, it’s a mere drop in an ocean of post-nap ecstasy for me.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a great way to publish IndieWeb content without having to do any special magic. Setting up this posting strategy has helped me evaluate how I handle notes on this website. My writing often contains short, daily reflections, but it may be worthwhile to move that to this section. Then I can reserve the writing area for longer-form content.

&lt;p&gt;Spring is here, I think? I spend the afternoon in the park with ex-colleague-turned-friend Susan, who is celebrating landing a new and challenging job. There&amp;rsquo;s a boy in the park who&amp;rsquo;s walking around barefoot. Later we see him on a slack line. I like this scene; it tells me that summer is almost upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never seem skilled at enjoying whatever season is here. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m forever yearning for what&amp;rsquo;s just out of reach. On Javastraat I pass a travel agency, the target audience of which most certainly is concerned with visiting Morocco or Turkey during the summer months. Surprisingly, there&amp;rsquo;s a wide array of names that would inspire city trips around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I passed the agency, Andrew Bird&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.studiopansa.com/studio-pansa-amstel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Studio Pansa Amstel&lt;/a&gt;, where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that&amp;rsquo;s so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is &amp;ldquo;dirty hands, clear mind&amp;rdquo;, and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker&amp;rsquo;s mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll sign up for one of Pansa&amp;rsquo;s courses myself some day.&lt;/p&gt;

            Meeting Yana and DJ

&lt;p&gt;What I love most about today&amp;rsquo;s snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful to welcome Yana into our home for the first time. When I hired her in the late Winter of 2022 as our newest UX designer, I knew there was something special about her. Now, well over a year later, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to call her a friend. We caught up on career adventures, new trends in the design industry, and of course the joys of being a dog mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Yana and DJ left, Anja and I began winding down for the day. After dinner, we watched the latest episode of the final season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, which may have been my favorite one yet. The characters on this show are so complex and candidly-written. I&amp;rsquo;m already low-key heartbroken that this show is going to end. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m also pleased to be alive to watch it unfold in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Life sure is different now that we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten Lemonade on a proper walking schedule. She still feels most comfortable going potty on the puppy pads we have on our balcony, but she absolutely loves going out and exploring the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how well she walks on a loose leash, and how few issues we&amp;rsquo;ve had with the stuff she puts in her mouth. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make most use of her imprint period, and that means familiarizing her with as many different things as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to find a cat on our morning walk. Lemonade responds to the cat the way I expected a dog would: oozing deference. They stand across from each other for a few minutes, and I reward Lemonade with cheese treats afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the first step on the road to Lemonade meeting Pookie, my mother-in-law&amp;rsquo;s cat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2023/02/12/all-saints-amsterdam/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;I knew I had found a special place&lt;/a&gt;. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times. I see All Saints regulars as well as new people, shy and seemingly hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman in particular stands out to me because she smiles intently at me a few times. She has the demeanor of that good Christian girl from that

Pre-pandemic memories begin to surface, and once she mentions her son I remember her again. &amp;ldquo;The first time I came here, I thought of you&amp;rdquo;, she says. We shmooze over crackers and sweet bread, exchange numbers to set a coffee date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new church is really a pilot by two reverends hoping to bring fully inclusive Christianity to the Amsterdam expat community. This is service eight out of ten. When I say that out loud, Reverend Howie casually says &amp;ldquo;yes, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to talk about that next time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already can&amp;rsquo;t imagine myself without this community.&lt;/p&gt;

            A very Mathilde visit
          
        </title>

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/04/08/a-very-mathilde-visit/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Much like last year, I&amp;rsquo;m so excited for Mathilde to visit our house that I get a headache just thinking about it. We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other 23 years, and, by miracle, our friendship is both acclimatized to our adult lives &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as full of energy and curiosity as it was when we met in our first year of secondary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She comes bearing gifts: seeds for the garden, dyke poetry, David Sedaris. She knows what I like. We eat, this time around I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it simple with dishes from the traiteur and not ten separate homemade recipes of intricate delicacies. We talk about what teaching means to her and Anja. We play with Lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a friend, Mathilde is very easy to love. Our times together eventually always bring us back to our shared emotional outlet: making music. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m nervous to sing around you, Zinzy&amp;rdquo; she says, but her voice sounds beautiful, warm, and exactly what my piano calls for. When I think of &amp;ldquo;blue-eyed soul&amp;rdquo; I think of Mathilde&amp;rsquo;s voice. We tell each other Anja and I will make it down south this year, and we&amp;rsquo;ll go for côte de bœuf in Maastricht. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Shervin at the coffee place this morning. We know each other very casually; we used to frequent the same co-working space, we&amp;rsquo;re LinkedIn friends. He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exchange how life is treating us, what we&amp;rsquo;re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing. He lets me in on secrets around the next meetup, and tells me what kind of activities are involved. It sounds magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s beauty in the not knowing, we agree. In the whimsy of the unexpected, the sudden connection we may feel with other humans. I tell him his project reminds me of Marina Abramović, whom Anja and I were fortunate enough to meditate with

            Week 11: Meeting Patrick

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;patrickrhone.com&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Patrick Rhone&lt;/a&gt; and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patrickrhone.net/13189-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;to catch the planning stage on his blog&lt;/a&gt; right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cafedetuin.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Cafe de Tuin&lt;/a&gt;, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing &amp;ldquo;raise a glass to freedom&amp;rdquo;. Fine people, they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After another week with Lemonade, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to feel more confident about raising her to be a well-behaved, confident puppy. For the most part, she&amp;rsquo;s doing very well. The only real challenge we have is the barking to which she&amp;rsquo;ll resort every time she&amp;rsquo;s in the crate but not sleeping. Through trial and error, we&amp;rsquo;re slowly learning how to help her settle down more easily, and this week, the efforts have begun to pay off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got some exciting news forthcoming that isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready for the public just yet, but it has managed to lift my spirits greatly. I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write more in the next few weeks, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say I&amp;rsquo;m feeling hopeful, inspired, and ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Anja had apparently been around to watch season one when it was released, I&amp;rsquo;ve only now turned onto the wonderful journey that is &lt;em&gt;Abbott Elementary&lt;/em&gt;. I would never actually ask the universe for a reboot of &lt;em&gt;The Office: US&lt;/em&gt;, but this new mockumentary revolving around a poorly-managed, underfunded Philadelphia public school has exactly the vibe I would&amp;rsquo;ve hoped to get from that nonexistent reboot. It&amp;rsquo;s just nice that, with this show, Black people are at the front and center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spring has officially begun, but as one of the regulars at my coffee place said: &amp;ldquo;the question isn&amp;rsquo;t when spring begins but when  rain ends&amp;rdquo;. It seems the weather&amp;rsquo;s getting better, though, and I can feel I&amp;rsquo;m on the cusp of storing away my winter coat. It has been a long time coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it so that, if a cog in the wheel doesn’t work, the entire thing falls apart? What a beautiful reflection, Adrianna. I’m glad I read it today.&lt;/p&gt;

            A phone call with an old friend
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/03/16/a-phone-call-with-an-old-friend/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -1600</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/03/16/a-phone-call-with-an-old-friend/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had emailed him late last year, missing our kitchen table conversations over coffee and cigarettes. His enormous house, a former school, functioning as his private art studio / gallery. He had replied right away, saying &amp;ldquo;my phone number is still the same&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had lost it long ago, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I walk home from a coffee run, I think of him, and decide that I should make one last attempt to find his phone number before emailing him again. Looking over his message, I notice he said he no longer lived in the old school, and something about nuns. I suppose I had overlooked it the first time I read it, imagining he lived &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; a convent rather than in an actual carmelite care facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friendly nun is happy to give me his number right away. A glimpse into a world of old, filled with kind people making generous assumptions. Two minutes later I hear his voice. &amp;ldquo;hello?&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not at all surprised you ended up living with a bunch of nuns, Paul&amp;rdquo; I glee into the phone, remembering our conversations about the Church, his Protestant, mine Catholic. There had always been something about Catholic liturgy that inspired him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his heavy bout of Covid, double pneumonia, and delirium, he still remembers me. Within minutes, we slide back into a conversation that never really began and never really ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us are still the same to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives me splinters of stories: a thieving cleaning lady, the storage and eventual donation of his body of work, the conversations he has with his neighbor priest. I tell him about Anja, about our small apartment, and about my eternal journey finding a Christian place I can call home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree that I&amp;rsquo;ll come visit soon, and I will. A few misremembered numbers and names aside, he&amp;rsquo;s still the same old Paul. But by God, he nearly wasn&amp;rsquo;t here, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve begun rewatching &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; again to prepare for its fourth and final season. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it yet, it is a pure Shakespearean spectacle worth every second. Never before had I seen a work of fiction in which every single character is an antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 10: Outings
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/03/12/week-10-outings/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of cocooning, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to see she&amp;rsquo;s such a relaxed and curious dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I was able to take this time off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing &amp;ldquo;giving up&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;letting go&amp;rdquo; for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, don&amp;rsquo;t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m not a proper Christian. Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping they&amp;rsquo;ll become best friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://anneliewambeek.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Annelie&lt;/a&gt; came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. She&amp;rsquo;s Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. She&amp;rsquo;s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Playing the piano is helping me put some puzzle pieces in the right place. I’ve always had the ability to reproduce the pitch of a song, but it wasn’t until I began playing the piano that I now seem able to identify the key by name. It may seem silly or small, but that’s a game-changer for me. It makes me feel that I can put everything together now; as though I’ve come full circle.&lt;/p&gt;

            Two weeks with a dog

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roi-of-good-research&#34;&gt;The ROI of good research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;McCann Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn&amp;rsquo;t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see how quickly she&amp;rsquo;s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann&amp;rsquo;s course 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Puppy Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-got-cabin-fever&#34;&gt;I got cabin fever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we&amp;rsquo;ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually let her &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt; just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It&amp;rsquo;s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-beauty-of-trust&#34;&gt;The beauty of trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they&amp;rsquo;ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it&amp;rsquo;s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she&amp;rsquo;s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I&amp;rsquo;m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love this essay, Simone. Fully embracing the very IndieWeb concept of a personal website has helped me shake this feeling of FOMO, I imagine the same way it did for you. Don&amp;rsquo;t be hard on yourself, though, we all fell for this concept, and many of us still do. If society presents something as a way to solve a problem, most people will eventually try it. And while it does solve &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; problems, it also creates others. I have a few Gen Z friends who never fail to make me feel old whenever they talk about &amp;ldquo;their personal brand&amp;rdquo; in an unironic way. Gives me the shivers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Darn Barry, I feel like 2023 is throwing you for quite a loop. Ever since you wrote about you getting laid off I think about you every now and then. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry this happened last week, although I must say I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a lucky thing those divvies wanted to get a break-in early bird special.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it&amp;rsquo;s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but fangirl. I&amp;rsquo;m here because she&amp;rsquo;s a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in

&lt;p&gt;Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20. Sometimes I wait outside for a few minutes until their doors open at 08:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Medium decaf mocaccino, half cow&amp;rsquo;s milk, half Tony Chocolonely.&amp;rdquo; I say it, but none of the baristas need reminding. Sometimes I bring my computer to work on my personal site, sometimes I bring a book and my diary. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who lives Saturday mornings like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I hung out, drawing people who were conducting a similar Saturday morning routine. A great start to the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

            Walking with Annelie

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/02/02/walking-with-annelie/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We&amp;rsquo;ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so &amp;ldquo;dress for cold, hope for warmth&amp;rdquo; I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so proud of the work Annelie has been doing,

We discuss productivity; tools, methods, apps, Etsy calendar print-outs. Today, I tell her how much

We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go full over-the-top with anything dog-related, and luckily Annelie is more than happy to review my birth announcement card options. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t radiate more enthusiasm about this dog if she tried. And she hasn&amp;rsquo;t even met her yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shmoozed over coffee, I was reminded of the time when doing this indoors wasn&amp;rsquo;t even possible. I remember the Coffee Company line going all the way around the block, the overflowing trash bins with paper coffee cups, the increasing amount of fresh air we were all taking in. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to spend time indoors again, but I do miss the park. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for spring to start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/31/that-was-january-2023/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;January flew, &lt;em&gt;flew&lt;/em&gt; by, I tell you. We started with &amp;ldquo;wow, 2023 already, let&amp;rsquo;s have a chill time this year, hey what&amp;rsquo;s on Netflix?&amp;rdquo; and at the time of writing everything is different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things are not chill, because we&amp;rsquo;re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cancelled Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for years that I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s never going to happen, but, hey, at least we&amp;rsquo;ll have that puppy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-puppy&#34;&gt;The puppy!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, we kicked off the year very quietly, thinking &amp;ldquo;meh, someone asked us if we wanted a puppy, but we&amp;rsquo;re not really sure just yet.&amp;rdquo; This all changed ones we learned that eight healthy puppies were born and we were allowed to pick first.

I appreciate how well this movie understands the finality of our social roles, and how, at the same time, they can be transformed in the blink of an eye. In addition, I am secretly a 13-year-old boy who likes to look at people drowning in their own vomit and excrement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;something-else&#34;&gt;Something else&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself looking for great influencers focused on gifted neurodivergence. Like those many awesome YouTubers sharing tips and tricks on how to live with ADHD, but for giftedness, and not in some Mensa kind of way, but just something that&amp;rsquo;s honest about the challenges one may encounter. Most of what I find is written by pedagogues for parents of gifted children. If you know of anything, feel free to

She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I&amp;rsquo;m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She&amp;rsquo;s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from bookshop owner she&amp;rsquo;s also a writer. I love the work she does at

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took it from the shelf, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they&amp;rsquo;re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don&amp;rsquo;t I see myself on television?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine the life of Cole&amp;rsquo;s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.&lt;/p&gt;

            ’Love Actually’, once again

        <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 00:00:00 -2100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/21/love-actually-once-again/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had two friends over today. They’re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we’d one day get together and watch &lt;em&gt;Love Actually&lt;/em&gt;, much-beloved by each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me I’m not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if there’s any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?&lt;/p&gt;

            Super-recognizer

        <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 -2000</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/20/super-recognizer/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don’t know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m learning it’s not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan. I only recently became aware how much of a jerk that makes me, and how, if we were in a room full of people, I’d stick out like a sore thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wondered if I could be classified as a super-recognizer. I remember taking the test a few years ago and stopping halfway through, fearing that I’d see the faces of the people in my dreams and nightmares for all of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in that supremely annoying stage of prospective dog ownership where I casually interrogate dog owners at parties, curious about their pet’s behavior and the techniques employed, and then silently judge them for their mistakes, exchanging contemptuous glances with Anja in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

            The game show
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/18/the-game-show/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 -1800</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/18/the-game-show/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang&amp;rsquo;s desire to blend in phonetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I&amp;rsquo;m from the South. I like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I&amp;rsquo;ve always been afraid to sound was &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I&amp;rsquo;m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it&amp;rsquo;s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I&amp;rsquo;m just struck by the number of times I asked &amp;ldquo;babe, is this the example we want to give?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself &amp;ldquo;argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!&amp;rdquo; Today is one of those days. I&amp;rsquo;m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed by the rediscovery of life&amp;rsquo;s unsteadiness. At the same time, there&amp;rsquo;s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I&amp;rsquo;ve been so anxious that bad news wasn&amp;rsquo;t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot better than rain all year round.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few days, I&amp;rsquo;ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there&amp;rsquo;s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I&amp;rsquo;m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://piano-music-theory.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Piano-Music-Theory.com&lt;/a&gt;, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life&amp;rsquo;s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/13/alt-text-culture/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to regard &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don&amp;rsquo;t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s slowest tooltip&amp;rdquo;. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing a growing number of people work &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text into places where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Places that don&amp;rsquo;t require a hover. Two examples of this are 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s profile and banner images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer&amp;rdquo;. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness — her self-awareness about what the image could convey — that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we&amp;rsquo;ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I&amp;rsquo;d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Piper Haywood&amp;rsquo;s blog 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;put me onto a handy &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text decision tree&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, &amp;ldquo;Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?&amp;rdquo;, is &amp;ldquo;use an empty &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t post the image&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we&amp;rsquo;ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We&amp;rsquo;re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I&amp;rsquo;m crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;2022 showed me&lt;/a&gt; that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn&amp;rsquo;t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world&amp;rsquo;s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s all about intuition and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &#39;The Whale&#39; for scale
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/11/the-whale-for-scale/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 -1100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2023/01/11/the-whale-for-scale/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s latest film &lt;em&gt;The Whale&lt;/em&gt;, one writer concluded that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don&amp;rsquo;t: judge the film before I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fat person, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about &lt;em&gt;The Whale&lt;/em&gt; puts a damper on that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser&amp;rsquo;s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, &lt;em&gt;The Whale&lt;/em&gt; reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to see themselves, employing &lt;em&gt;The Whale&lt;/em&gt; for scale.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at &lt;em&gt;Triangle of Sadness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;White Noise&lt;/em&gt;. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I&amp;rsquo;d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you&amp;rsquo;ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says &amp;ldquo;wtf&amp;rdquo; and your heart goes &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 51: The piano

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said &amp;ldquo;where are the tea lights?&amp;rdquo;, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was all about the new piano I bought. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking or talking about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All I&amp;rsquo;ll say is: this piano project is the first one I&amp;rsquo;m approaching through a neurodiverse lens, and it&amp;rsquo;s making everything &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much smoother and funner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegally, I&amp;rsquo;m mentioning something that happened in week 50. A. took me for my annual Fancy Birthday Dinner. For the first time since we began dating, I told her to leave it a surprise. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s one of those benefits of having gone to in-patient eating disorder treatment: chill vibes about food surprises. If you ever have an appetite for exquisite 10-course Asian fusion dining, book a table at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://101gowrie.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;101 Gowrie&lt;/a&gt;, where the atmosphere is as beautiful as the tableware, the bread is to cry over, and the umami is so intense that you&amp;rsquo;ll have trouble putting it into words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed a two-nighter to finish watching &lt;em&gt;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m very much at that point in my mid-thirties where finishing a feature film under a warm blanket on the sofa after 8 p.m. is a challenge. I love whodunits — the genre might be in my top three — but I was quite disappointed to learn that both A. and I were able to guess the ending within the first five minutes. Janelle Monáe and Kathryn Hahn looked great nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All week, people kept asking me what I&amp;rsquo;d be doing for Christmas, and I&amp;rsquo;d cheerfully reply &amp;ldquo;Nothing! You?&amp;rdquo; every time. I feel liberated from the pressure to spend time with family or friends during the holidays, to eat more than I can carry, and to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; fun. We certainly did have fun, just in a &amp;ldquo;really couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered&amp;rdquo; kind of way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made my first batch of heavenly mud, a rich, creamy chocolate dessert. It was heavenly.&lt;/li&gt;

            Week 47: Booster
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2022/11/27/week-47-booster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 -2700</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2022/11/27/week-47-booster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long. I mimic my late stepfather, who used to wimper like a puppy whenever he got a cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still do well to limit my hours of screen time. Before I know it, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with a headache and dizzy spell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify&amp;rsquo;s Discover Weekly was on point this week. Aside from lovely &amp;ldquo;beards and log cabin&amp;rdquo; tunes, as I call 70s soft rock, I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen hard for the hyper pop track 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4n0sVfRnd0UJsqcbPj7GqN?si=Z5yeyS2xTjOEWlOSI5EnmQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Notice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Moe Shop and Toriena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We raced through another season of &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;, this time with the excellent Elizabeth Debicki as Diana. I love how she manages to capture Diana so well despite &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; because of her camp-adjacent interpretation of her. I wonder if she ever got a sore neck during taping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After protesting for weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally let Anja turn on the heating. So far, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much up-close experience with the energy crisis the world is currently facing, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to change. It&amp;rsquo;s great to feel my toes, though.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally don&amp;rsquo;t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to document what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-this-is-great&#34;&gt;Why this is great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hold the strong belief that tools don&amp;rsquo;t matter. This means, among other things, that I don&amp;rsquo;t like to be limited to using particular platforms or apps to write. I want to see my files in a folder that I can move around. Jekyll allows me to do just this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My website is a text-heavy space: most of what you&amp;rsquo;ll find on here is written content. As a knowledge worker, writing is an integral part of my daily life. Many of the things I write are not for public consumption, but they are closely linked to things that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid duplicate content and awkward linking, it was important for me to manage my text files in a single space, one Obsidian vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a tendency to tinker a lot on my website. This can make it so that I spend more time trying out new things and changing the design than I do writing. Having my code base and content separated helps me focus more on writing things that are meaningful to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-things-i-havent-figured-out-yet&#34;&gt;Some things I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out yet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it worthwhile for me to publish more granular IndieWeb post types such as notes and likes? Do I care about them? Am I making them only to show them? What&amp;rsquo;s their value if I cannot automate this process? Does the technical implementation change if I push said content to a git repository that consists of only notes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does a proper dark mode look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to continue my barebones experiment and document the discomfort of vanity? Or am I ready for something more modern?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How in the world do I even go about Micropub and Webmentions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work for me, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;The Midnight Library&lt;/em&gt;, which I had borrowed from

It sure has been a long time since I last read a book that was both so entertaining and easygoing. It feels borderline young adult, and entirely unpretentious.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Each year I&amp;rsquo;m less embarrassed to say it: I don&amp;rsquo;t like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there&amp;rsquo;s King&amp;rsquo;s Day and Liberation Day, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it really messes with my head. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I learn that bolognese is a great base for chili, as long as you add enough cumin, beef, and beer. We watch &lt;em&gt;The Undoing&lt;/em&gt;, which is a surprisingly great decision of Hugh Grant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak. He laughs when I bop his nose, although I quickly learn that the force with which I bop Anja&amp;rsquo;s adult nose shan&amp;rsquo;t be applied here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a French bakery in Amsterdam that I visit on Wednesday with my colleague Ruby. Since their actual oven is somewhere else, I wonder if the shop even calls itself a bakery. After all, French standards would forbid it. The caramel éclair reminds me of that time at

The bread has been in the window too long. I ask if they have plastic bags, and I&amp;rsquo;m told no. I say I think that should be illegal in bakeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My childhood friend Mathilde comes for dinner on Sunday. Anja and I are giddy with excitement. In preparation, we practice our harmonies to Alanis Morissette&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ironic&amp;quot;over voice messages. Her husband asks her if she, too, heard the cat meowing. We&amp;rsquo;re celebrating her birthday, and I got her gifts at

When I ask them about the East-Asian gay guy who writes letters to his mom, they immediately give me Ocean Vuong&amp;rsquo;s new book of poetry. Seeing her again, I better understand what It means to have a soulmate. I sing so loud I give myself a migraine. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up

I was missing some functionalities that are natural to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault. I could make a spiel about how I love the &amp;ldquo;slow web&amp;rdquo;-ness of writing things on my phone and only publishing them when I&amp;rsquo;m on my computer, but I simply haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to do it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 13: Recruiting
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2022/04/02/week-13-recruiting/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble understanding whether I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I&amp;rsquo;ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-work&#34;&gt;At work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leeruniek&amp;rsquo;s Product team is hiring, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been the one taking care of the recruitment process for two engineering and one design role. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new front-end engineer as well as a designer within two months, so I suppose you could say I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. If this process has been teaching me anything new, it&amp;rsquo;s that 1) I very much enjoy meeting people and learning about their (work) life stories, 2) there is such value in building strong relationships with recruiters who make you smile, and 3) it takes two weeks of introdutory chats before I begin to regret having to listen to my own voice give the same pitch over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-home&#34;&gt;At home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another secret blessing of Covid has been the ability to spend more time at home, which, for me, immediately translates to the ability to better consider how I value my home environment. We&amp;rsquo;ve been churning through a pretty long list of home improvement projects, the absolute highlight so far having been installing a projector and theatre screen in the living room. Last weekend, we finished most of the work on our kitchen remodelling by putting in new counter tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;Cooking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, we found some new recipes that we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed refining:&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with Namiko Hirasawa Chen&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of Dutch documentaries on the effects Internet culture has on children.

I particularly enjoyed &lt;em&gt;My Daughter, the Vlogger&lt;/em&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what it&amp;rsquo;s like to raise a child, and I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what it would be like in 2022. Still, &amp;ldquo;all her peers will have a YouTube channel by the time they are six, she might as well get a leg up&amp;rdquo; sounds sad coming out of the mouth of a 3-year-old&amp;rsquo;s mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;listening&#34;&gt;Listening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing Heardle and loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you &amp;ldquo;leave it cleaner than you found it&amp;rdquo; and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re gone after two days. At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining &amp;ldquo;Bonsoihoir&amp;rdquo;. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, &amp;ldquo;no, not for champagne, just for the drinks&amp;rdquo;. I also really don&amp;rsquo;t like ticks, and I simply can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that Norway somehow doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve begun hosting dinner parties again.

With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I&amp;rsquo;m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I&amp;rsquo;ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite&amp;rsquo;s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn&amp;rsquo;t even think of it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I watched a few horror films, &lt;em&gt;Midsommar&lt;/em&gt; being the favorite. I also watched &lt;em&gt;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&lt;/em&gt; (2022), which wasn&amp;rsquo;t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of &lt;em&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/em&gt;, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin résumé aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.&lt;/p&gt;

            A believable truth
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2021/07/18/a-believable-truth/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 00:00:00 -1800</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2021/07/18/a-believable-truth/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I never get much reading done unless I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I&amp;rsquo;m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling like a million bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I&amp;rsquo;ve limited myself to one: &lt;em&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Mary Magdalene Revealed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she&amp;rsquo;s going. Every now and then, I&amp;rsquo;ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you find this book a bit&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt;-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene&amp;rsquo;s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;rsquo;s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now it is such a cliché to even say it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the monolith that we&amp;rsquo;ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was written as part of 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vineandfig.co&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Vine &amp;amp; Fig&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp;amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter asked, and it did not barter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I&amp;rsquo;m sitting, I can see that this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have &lt;em&gt;gotten&lt;/em&gt; this whole queer thing. They&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for &amp;ldquo;this phase&amp;rdquo; to end for years. In their household, there is simply no &amp;ldquo;love for the gays&amp;rdquo;. It took a conversation with our friend&amp;rsquo;s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy&lt;/em&gt; makes everything better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at

&lt;p&gt;In the window of Meijssen they&amp;rsquo;re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They&amp;rsquo;re surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I&amp;rsquo;m a part, a White lesbian asked me: &amp;ldquo;when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; join?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great questions,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;my response is identical to what you would say if someone went &amp;lsquo;why do you need lesbian bars? You don&amp;rsquo;t see me going to a straight bar, do you?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fair enough&amp;rdquo; said the White lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an app called 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://liberatemeditation.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Liberate&lt;/a&gt;. It has beautiful meditations by Black and Indigenous teachers. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a Headspace fan. Despite founder Andy&amp;rsquo;s cringey &amp;ldquo;I lived with the monks so you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&amp;rdquo; marketing strategy, I appreciate the app for its interface and quality content. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t occured to me that the experiences I have as an Afropean could find their place in a meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me feels too indulgent for enjoying Liberate as much as I do. Listening to meditation teachers who have the understanding that microagressions are an actual reality in my actual life is just so different and amazing. Still, my subconscious feels sorry for the theoretical White people who would be uncomfortable if they found out I listen to Black meditations. &lt;em&gt;Why even bring your identity into it?!&lt;/em&gt; Like a lesbian momentarily forgetting she&amp;rsquo;s allowed her lesbian bar.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I&amp;rsquo;m at

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can&amp;rsquo;t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sneezes, and I remark how, since March 2020, &amp;ldquo;gesundheit&amp;rdquo; has been replaced by dirty looks. &amp;ldquo;I need my allergy meds&amp;rdquo; she says, in her voice a hint of embarrassment. Then she tells me about her successes of late: she and the old English Bulldog next to her have finally begun frequenting the neighborhood bars again, the ones &amp;ldquo;where everyone recognizes them&amp;rdquo;. She&amp;rsquo;s also been making lots of new friends. She suspects it&amp;rsquo;s the sign she&amp;rsquo;s been sporting on her mobility scooter, which reads &lt;em&gt;if I die because of Covid, it&amp;rsquo;s not your fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel so sorry for all the young people, you know? One of them told me they were scared to go out and party, fearing their reckless behavior would kill their grandparents. You know what I told him? I told him it wasn&amp;rsquo;t his fault. And you know what? He fell into my arms crying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t missed a single Sunday protest on Museum Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really insane, the weaponry and violence that are on standby on Sundays. I&amp;rsquo;m from Belfast, you know, so you could say I&amp;rsquo;ve been around the block a few times. Even in Belfast, during our protests, they only pulled out weapons when things got really tough. Here, it seems that&amp;rsquo;s their only strategy. And I&amp;rsquo;m from Belfast, go figure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Anja and I go to

Upon arrival, before I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to discern whether I&amp;rsquo;d like to consent to anything, I receive a warm hug from my friend, and a handshake from a total stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the pandemic such a fickle game is that nobody looks like they&amp;rsquo;re infected. Everyone who breaches my personal space looks kind. Still, the Delta variant is coming for us, and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how much my conservatism sticks out like a sore thumb everywhere I go.&lt;/p&gt;

            3 years sober
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 00:00:00 -0200</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, completing our visit with Anneli and Milan, I said calmly to Anja:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think I may try not drinking for a week or so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter. The father is an excellent home chef, and so we quickly bonded over soul food, shared political views, and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my mind at all. I didn&amp;rsquo;t drink more than three glasses of red during my entire stay with them. Instead, Anja and I were just&amp;hellip; part of their warm family dynamic. Eating jubileumskaka for breakfast, reading stories before bed. I was overwhelmed by how secure I felt in their presence, so much so that I cried when we left. It was a week to remember. Looking back, I can see that it must have been this sudden sense of security, entirely unfamiliar to my person, that made me realize what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;embracing-sobriety&#34;&gt;Embracing sobriety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one week of not drinking has yet to end (and I don&amp;rsquo;t plan for it to). Those first few months after our Stockholm trip, not drinking was embarrassingly easy. I had done it before, and Anja doesn&amp;rsquo;t really ever drink, and so our dinner parties, get-togethers, and outings were never awkward for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even celebrate my one year of not drinking because it just&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t a thing to me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even feel like I was sober. Not until the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a dear childhood friend who is as troubled a soul as I was for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that to sound like a know-it-all, I&amp;rsquo;m just in a different place now. They have a habit of only reaching out to me when they&amp;rsquo;re doing well, and so whenever things are rough, they fall off my radar. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t spoken in a while and when they did in the late Fall of 2018, the good news was that they were entering into rehab. The bad news had been that they had fallen homeless and that they were battling a coke addiction on top of what I had already identified as a dependency on other substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day of 2019 rolled around, I received an email from their sister with the invitation to write my friend an intervention letter. They would be using mine, as well as those of another friend and a few relatives to support my friend&amp;rsquo;s treatment program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sobriety-means-alcoholic&#34;&gt;Sobriety means alcoholic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first draft of the letter was ready within the hour. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been at ease with writing, and so putting into words what my friend&amp;rsquo;s addiction had done to me was fairly easy. I let Anja read the letter right away. Once she finished, she looked up at me with a face full of discomfort. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong?&amp;rdquo; I asked her. After hesitating for a few moments, she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope you won&amp;rsquo;t be mad when I tell you this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is entirely true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t mad. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand what she was talking about. My letter was heartfelt and kind, hopeful and supporting, and I had explained to my friend how their drinking made them an untrustworthy friend, how their asking for money was awkward, and how much it hurt. Anja saw more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she started uncovering some truths that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t ever acknowledged, at least not to their full extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, I recall you making comments about their drinking and drug use quite often, when in reality your relationship with alcohol isn&amp;rsquo;t super healthy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had known that for some time. Heck, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even had a drink in almost a year. Not drinking comes with a few perks, though. One of them is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to acknowledge that your drinking is actually a problem. That day was the first day that I realized that my relationship with alcohol makes me an alcoholic. I was in such denial about that for so long that my childhood friend&amp;rsquo;s problems had come to function as a lightning rod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filling-in-the-blanks-i-had-forgotten-were-there&#34;&gt;Filling in the blanks I had forgotten were there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve emotionally transitioned from being simply dry to being sober, a whole new world has opened up. I get to look at my family&amp;rsquo;s relationship with alcohol with much more clarity. I can see how alcohol was my ultimate vice in battling feelings of unworthiness, and how it oddly enough magnified those feelings. My subconscious is slowly filling in the blanks that I had forgotten were there. To me, alcohol equates forgetting, forgetting, forgetting. So much forgetting, in fact, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know how much I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-needs-mending&#34;&gt;What needs mending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a minimized dependency on alcohol, I have started to work on things that have been with me for decades. And I have a sobriety counter on my watch. I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the reminder every day, but I want it. I think of

After successfully completing their rehab program, my childhood friend is back on drugs again, and supporting themselves with escort work. There&amp;rsquo;s a very fine line between me and that. For a long time I thought it was studying it in detail and deriving life lessons from it. Today, I celebrate 1095 days of making the right decision, and a little over two years of turning inward to see what needs mending.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I&amp;rsquo;ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it through two seasons of &lt;em&gt;Love After Lockup&lt;/em&gt; and six seasons of &lt;em&gt;Sister Wives&lt;/em&gt;. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I don&amp;rsquo;t want &lt;em&gt;Sister Wives&lt;/em&gt; to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the trailer for &lt;em&gt;

People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready for

            Morning habits

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2021/04/14/morning-habits/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always able to execute on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk for one hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrive home and update YNAB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan my day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty my email inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a smoothie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start my daily meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren&amp;rsquo;t assigned at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo;, but really I&amp;rsquo;ll listen to anything that&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn&amp;rsquo;t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; that I was assigned at birth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but also&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo;. To me, &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in &lt;em&gt;Death Becomes Her&lt;/em&gt;. A woman can be a &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo;, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being called &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo;, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It&amp;rsquo;s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the same defition of &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.&lt;/p&gt;

            Aging: part one
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2021/03/12/aging-part-one/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -1200</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2021/03/12/aging-part-one/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates. There&amp;rsquo;s a skate store around the block from my house, and whenever I&amp;rsquo;d pass it, I&amp;rsquo;d find myself right back in the best part of my childhood. For five years, though, I never got around to actually buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like what seems everyone in Amsterdam and their grandmother, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally purchased a nice pair of skates. I got FR freeskates with three 110mm wheels as well as the protection gear I was always too cool to wear as a child. And when I say &amp;ldquo;everyone and their grandmother&amp;rdquo;, I mean enough people to keep me waiting for those skates for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a person who appreciates the (near-)instant gratification of next-day-delivery, waiting two weeks for a purchase to arrive seemed like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did with that eternity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched at least ten hours of freeskating flow videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplated whether I should cancel my order and find less amazing skates that would arrive sooner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminisce about how awesome skating felt when I was a child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was probably due to all this reminiscing that the concept of skating turned into an activity that you can&amp;rsquo;t unlearn, much like biking. My body remembered all the slides I could do, and the countless ways to stop. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be able to take my skates out to the park within the first week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, twenty years afer I last skated, I unboxed and attempted to get into the skates. It took 30 minutes to figure out how to unlock the cuffs alone. Then it took ten minutes per skate to get the things on my feet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been awkwardly rolling around the living room ever since, grabbing onto chairs and door frames, unsure of which muscles I need to keep from falling and breaking off my front teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere near old enough to complain about aging or being too old for shit, but at 33, I&amp;rsquo;m slowly embracing the concept of micro-aging. From time to time, I will meet something that confirms that my body, my mind, and my experiences have changed drastically from what they were when I was a child. From time to time, something will remind me that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer 17, and right now, skating is it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&lt;br&gt;
feel that I am&lt;br&gt;
a&lt;br&gt;
bad&lt;br&gt;
Black&lt;br&gt;
girl&lt;br&gt;
because whenever&lt;br&gt;
my white girlfriend&lt;br&gt;
and I sift through&lt;br&gt;
Netflix&lt;br&gt;
Prime Video&lt;br&gt;
or anything&lt;br&gt;
with a reasonable trial&lt;br&gt;
period&lt;br&gt;
and she says &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
watch this&lt;br&gt;
movie or that&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
featuring Black stories&lt;br&gt;
I instead&lt;br&gt;
elect to watch a white&lt;br&gt;
narrative&lt;br&gt;
because it&amp;rsquo;s nice&lt;br&gt;
to forget&lt;br&gt;
about&lt;br&gt;
racism&lt;br&gt;
and the teacher&lt;br&gt;
who called me&lt;br&gt;
a monkey&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
the no one&lt;br&gt;
who called him&lt;br&gt;
out&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
being a bit&lt;br&gt;
Black&lt;br&gt;
and being&lt;br&gt;
a bit&lt;br&gt;
white&lt;/p&gt;

            Week 2: Home office
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2021/01/17/week-2-home-office/</link>

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2021/01/17/week-2-home-office/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Work is so great!&amp;rdquo; I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn&amp;rsquo;t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says &amp;ldquo;like, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, it&amp;rsquo;s, like, just typically English&amp;rdquo;, and we both smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A&amp;rsquo;s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, my

After a beautiful day at the home office, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don&amp;rsquo;t need her parentification&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the

A tells me she&amp;rsquo;s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as she hands you the gift&lt;br&gt;
you know it’s another one&lt;br&gt;
“Trans Life Survivors”&lt;br&gt;
says the cover&lt;br&gt;
“Merry Christmas!”&lt;br&gt;
says your sister&lt;br&gt;
you have only been using&lt;br&gt;
they/them pronouns&lt;br&gt;
in private&lt;br&gt;
for a year or so&lt;br&gt;
it’ll look so beautiful next to&lt;br&gt;
the ex-gay book&lt;br&gt;
your other sister presented to you&lt;br&gt;
on your birthday last month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At family dinner you&lt;br&gt;
spend bathroom breaks in your&lt;br&gt;
childhood bedroom&lt;br&gt;
five in total&lt;br&gt;
logging on to talk to us&lt;br&gt;
about how the heavy things feel&lt;br&gt;
being the punching bag&lt;br&gt;
on which your 11-year-old cousin&lt;br&gt;
practises her right hook&lt;br&gt;
screaming fire about&lt;br&gt;
her trans classmate&lt;br&gt;
stings&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
it stings&lt;br&gt;
like a shattered jaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your father-in-law planned a&lt;br&gt;
Christmas pub crawl of sorts&lt;br&gt;
Covid-style&lt;br&gt;
each of the siblings hosting&lt;br&gt;
the entire family&lt;br&gt;
for a portion of the day&lt;br&gt;
hopping from house to house&lt;br&gt;
eating, drinking, loving the way only&lt;br&gt;
a big family will&lt;br&gt;
At the fourth stop you are full&lt;br&gt;
zonking off into the distance&lt;br&gt;
catching the smiling face of your&lt;br&gt;
sister-in-law on the way there&lt;br&gt;
and you remember what&lt;br&gt;
it felt like when&lt;br&gt;
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you and them&lt;br&gt;
there is no Family&lt;br&gt;
not since you came out as non-binary&lt;br&gt;
and your parents&lt;br&gt;
yelled&lt;br&gt;
“check please”&lt;br&gt;
the only trace of&lt;br&gt;
those you came from&lt;br&gt;
is the card your grandmother sent&lt;br&gt;
She writes “I wanted you to&lt;br&gt;
know I support you”&lt;br&gt;
She is a sweetheart&lt;br&gt;
it is a teardrop in the desert&lt;br&gt;
that you cling to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your father was no exception&lt;br&gt;
first the pandemic&lt;br&gt;
now the respirator&lt;br&gt;
the store has been extra busy these days&lt;br&gt;
but you’re getting by&lt;br&gt;
it’s keeping your mind off&lt;br&gt;
of how much he was hoping&lt;br&gt;
you’ll find a girl someday soon&lt;br&gt;
Today, the phone call&lt;br&gt;
from the hospital&lt;br&gt;
lets you know that&lt;br&gt;
he can come home for Christmas&lt;br&gt;
The disappointment you feel&lt;br&gt;
sits in your body like a monster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have all the time in the world&lt;br&gt;
to tell me how you’re doing&lt;br&gt;
but not a moment to yourself&lt;br&gt;
to commit to the act&lt;br&gt;
with all those relatives in the house&lt;br&gt;
prone to restricting themselves to&lt;br&gt;
those parts of the Bible&lt;br&gt;
that make Christianity look easy&lt;br&gt;
and you being back&lt;br&gt;
in the home of your youth&lt;br&gt;
after the attempt&lt;br&gt;
confirms what you fear and&lt;br&gt;
what your parents have been saying&lt;br&gt;
is true about your life&lt;br&gt;
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”&lt;br&gt;
your father said&lt;br&gt;
You wonder how gay&lt;br&gt;
he knows you are&lt;br&gt;
I wonder where you’ve hidden&lt;br&gt;
the Pride flag that I sent you&lt;br&gt;
as a housewarming gift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 3:26 The freedom of HaShem is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of thoughts, opinions, ideas, and tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered in my 33rd year on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working from home does wonders for my productivity and mental health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the term &amp;ldquo;Torah-observant Catholic&amp;rdquo; for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I wish I could just answer &amp;lsquo;

&lt;li&gt;We got COVID-19 and it was terrifying, even without a hospital stay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very liberating to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about that&amp;rdquo; when people ask small talk questions about my family or past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This

&lt;li&gt;I found a new job at a company that does great things for the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My favorite part of the pandemic, after &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, was Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign team sending out a newsletter every 40 minutes on Election day&lt;/li&gt;

            Of bridges and neighbors
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2020/11/29/of-bridges-and-neighbors/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 00:00:00 -2900</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2020/11/29/of-bridges-and-neighbors/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp;amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics. When it comes to the bridge between us and the rest of the world, I focus most of my efforts on building not the bridge’s deck but its foundation. The part that contains the strong back and self love required to even begin thinking about making it to the deck, which is where all the difficult dialogues happen. You know, the ones about whether or not we’re inherently disordered and whether we should ever experience physical intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image of a bridge stretching from the feet of one group to another fits in beautifully with my theology. That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Law, the rest is commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fantasy of pontifical bridges stretching from one people to the next was quite short-lived. “It’s a bridge between mankind and God, babe, not Catholics and everybody else”, my partner mumbled. An anti-clerical lesbian raised on the feminism of her Jewish hippie mom, she doesn’t own a pair of rosy glasses polished by my warm memories of Christmas-time pews overflowing with chilly bodies in warm coats. The Church does not invoke tender feelings of heritage for her. Wikipedia told me she was right about where that bridge leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our Pope is our bridge, he is also a model. He reminds us, simply by showing up, that we must strive for a connection with God; one that will help us believe the correct thing and do what is righteous, so that we will not be forgotten when the time comes. We dream, for ourselves and for our neighbors, of bridges, thick as concrete, paved smoothly with whatever pleases HaShem as well as our abstinence from sin. We have that light, and by God, we will bring salvation to the ends of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as we read Romans 10, which is to say Paul’s conversion strategy for the Jews and Gentiles, we get to meditate on that light, and how beautiful it is that we can share it with our neighbors. In the days of the men who wrote what we’ve come to know as the Pauline Epistles, the act of embracing Gentiles and Jews alike in the image of Christ must have been such a beautiful, tender aspiration. Today, however, their words evoke something different altogether. They remind me that those of us who don’t think the Epistle to the Romans should come with a trigger warning, simply haven’t spent enough time with actual Jews. Or really any person who has felt the foot of the Church on their own foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, there’s a thing us Christians are primed to overlook when we engage with the world, filled with the warmth of Jesus: we are taught to long for that strong spiritual connection with The Above so fervently, that we often do it at the expense of whoever else is with us in The Below. Why do so many of our bridges lean on the backs of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell the Jews the Messiah has already come and how they’re missing out. Make sure you make ‘em really feel it. Take their book and forget it was ever even theirs. Don’t vaccinate. Don’t gay. Choose purity culture over an actual human’s life, choose a pastor over a child. Choose a child over a woman, choose one color over the others. Go to Africa and do things so that you feel charitable. Go anywhere but home to help your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we welcome the Season of advent — and truly, I hope it will fill our sore hearts with anticipation and longing — I want to begin reimagining the bridge between myself and God. May it be paved with whatever pleases Her as well as my abstinence from sin. May it remind me that I am allowed a seat at the table, and that this table is one to share. May my bridge be made up of all the bridges I build between myself and my neighbors, so that we may travel between this island and another.&lt;/p&gt;

            Hell is other people
          
        </title>

        <pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 -2200</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2020/11/22/hell-is-other-people/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people&amp;rsquo;s bodies. My Jewish partner will do the eye roll of eye rolls and say: “funny how you all kind of &lt;em&gt;do that&lt;/em&gt;, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s right: we Christians have a peculiar propensity for thinking ourselves better than the rest. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking communal, but rather individual superiority. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite basic. We all have our individual interpretation of what signifies the core and what is merely peripheral in God’s message to the people. I may very well believe that God&amp;rsquo;s love can triumph when we give queer people room to breathe (which is to say to live, love, and all that comes with it), but another equally Christian Christian may think this triumph of love requires the exact opposite response. Despite this reality, we deem ourselves the Good Follower, and the other one Not A Real Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell is other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I open my Bible to Ezekiel 34, I hear the echo of the Parable of the Lost Sheep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something so tender and kind in both these texts; no matter who or where or how lost, we are all equally important to God. Even when we sin, through repentance we can be found again. But who is a sinner and who needs repentance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many people in the flock, the entire Vine &amp;amp; Fig community is a sinner in need of repentance. Disguised as well-intended good Christian ministry, their anti-queer violence saturates our daily lives. And let’s be clear: when I say violence, I don&amp;rsquo;t just mean the 350 trans and gender diverse individuals who were murdered in the past twelve months. I mean your brother who didn&amp;rsquo;t come to your wedding, and your mother who keeps saying she &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in gender diversity&amp;rdquo;. I mean your employer who forces you to sign a document indicating that you condemn homosexuality while you try to hide your girlfriend from your Instagram timeline. I mean the godawful things your siblings parrot over Sunday supper, and your father reminding them all that he has no love in his heart for gay people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, it’s great that you have your flock, my man, but should we queer people even want to be a part of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to think ‘yes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because hell is other people, and during our journey towards them we encounter God. When I dive deeper into Ezekiel 34 and the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the words take on a new meaning. To me, they are not a personal consolation, reminding me that I will be found if I’m lost. They tell me, above anything, that I am part of a single enormous flock, made up of everyone, filled with people whom I think are lost, and who, in turn, believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone astray. The passage tells me to love God above all else, and my neighbor as myself. Even if that neighbor is keeping their foot on my foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What might that love look like?” we all rightfully ask, immediately. In my case, love may be a ‘yes’ and it may be a ‘no’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “yes, you are right, thank you for teaching me about yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a “no, what you are saying about me and my siblings is false, destructive, and traumatizing. Here, let me help you see things through a new lens so that we can coexist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through God, I am granted the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we&amp;rsquo;ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What&amp;rsquo;s more, five years is a good run, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;rsquo;re a smaller team than what I worked with the past five years, and I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what impact that has on the way I work.&lt;/p&gt;

            The benefit of discontent

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;America Magazine&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn&amp;rsquo;t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions. My most vivid recollection of the Church&amp;rsquo;s stance on sexual matters is &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;JP II blaming the child abuse horror on the gays&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I became involved in queer Catholic collective &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Vine &amp;amp; Fig&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, I have learnt something about myself and that is that I am very privileged. While many of my queer Catholic siblings fight daily battles for their identities and experiences with the people in their homes and lives, I&amp;rsquo;m only a single Pride Week removed from walking into Sunday Mass in a three-piece rainbow suit and a pink yarmulke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this privileged confidence, I appreciate the shout-out, but I have no need for it. I know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God &amp;ldquo;endorsed&amp;rdquo; LGBTQ+ people when he created us.&amp;rdquo; — &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Matt Nightingale&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, to most affirming queer Catholics everywhere, Pope Francis&amp;rsquo; message was a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis certainly is not the first religious person to say that we queer individuals are children of God. Many affirming religious institutions, organizations, and individuals paved the way for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something here that requires our close attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming-yet-staunchly-anti-queer congregations, Christians evangelizing &amp;lsquo;hate the sin, love the sinner&amp;rsquo; rhetoric, and conversion &amp;rsquo;therapy&amp;rsquo; programmes have been saying that we are loved by God for decades. Their message doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever usher in the paradigm shift we hope for. Much rather, it invites queer people to be vulnerable, and then once we are, things take a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Queer people are children of God&amp;rdquo; can be a godsend, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it can be a dog whistle. A poetic way of saying &amp;lsquo;oh it&amp;rsquo;s okay to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; queer, it&amp;rsquo;s just very wrong to do it&amp;rsquo;, without having to take full responsibility for the origin and ramifications of your anti-queerness. After all, if your conviction is that queerness is a character flaw and not a glorious attribute inextricably connected to the soul, then technically you&amp;rsquo;re not lying. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple &amp;lsquo;Queer people are children of God, they just need to be saved&amp;rsquo;, if you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular form of anti-queerness has the potential to be much more damaging than the odd &amp;lsquo;hey you, dyke!&amp;rsquo; I may receive in the streets of Amsterdam. It reels us in and makes us believe we are safe. It is reminiscent of the dad in &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;, who would&amp;rsquo;ve voted for Obama a third time but who also performs horror procedures on Black humans in his basement. It&amp;rsquo;s reminiscent of the friendly, middle-aged, Austrian trumpet player who has a nazi shrine for a basement in &lt;em&gt;Im Keller&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The church loves our children as they are&amp;rdquo; unsettles me, because I have been on the receiving end of an anti-queerness (and a racism, for that matter) that is very friendly and welcoming at face value. Its eventual uncanniness is &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;. I want to know what&amp;rsquo;s in the basement. And as you know: with every good story, there&amp;rsquo;s always a basement.&lt;/p&gt;

            That time we were the first to get Covid

        <pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -2000</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2020/09/20/that-time-we-were-the-first-to-get-covid/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam&amp;rsquo;s patient zero is a woman who just happens to have spent early 2020 in the north of Italy. She has a son who attends the high school which just happens to be Anja&amp;rsquo;s place of employment. Anja is the first person I know to be infected with Covid 19. I am the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in travel technology, my experience of the outbreak of Covid 19 was colored by coworkers wondering by the water cooler what all the fuss was about. The most vocal among them are Rotterdammers, a people known, if anything, for its no-nonsense approach to trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anja and I have a different disposition. Both of us have sensitive danger antennas. They were activated on numerous occasions since late last year, with us getting increasingly more worried every time the word &amp;ldquo;Covid&amp;rdquo; was mentioned on the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, by early March, I was coming into the office every day, telling myself I was being too cautious. Until one day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have one colleague with an immunocompromised wife. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the way he leaned back in his chair when I came closer to ask him a question. Rightly so, it turned out, because within a day Anja developed a cough I had never heard before in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to imagine, but travel back with me to the beginning of this year. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re fine, this virus won&amp;rsquo;t reach us. And if it does, it&amp;rsquo;s not life-threatening for most of society&amp;rdquo; the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Could you please stop calling, ma&amp;rsquo;am? I&amp;rsquo;ve told you before it&amp;rsquo;s just a mild flu for people your age, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do anything for you anyway if you come in&amp;rdquo;, my doctor&amp;rsquo;s assistant said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until two weeks in that Anja was invited to come to a pop-up testing facility. Not the ones we have now, but a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office somewhere in Amsterdam that had been turned into a quarantine zone, people in white suits everywhere. Two weeks after that, we had an appointment at the hospital, which had built a testing facility in the parking lot. I waited outside in a tent with a heater as Anja underwent a battery of tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who went in before her was admitted to the ICU. I prayed rosary after rosary, wondering how in the world I&amp;rsquo;d get the car home without a license. What felt like hours was really 18 minutes when Anja walked out of the facility. Her cough was terrible, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long Covid. Meanwhile, my Covid was barely a sniffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I used Instagram to chronicle our experiences. I was getting hundreds of messages a day, and sharing little stories on the platform was a quicker way of updating everyone. I was just going through the archive and noticed that, at some point, the Covid-themed stories just stopped. It&amp;rsquo;s because, after six weeks or so, Anja slowly started to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No long Covid, no long-lasting results, a little bit of tiredness. We&amp;rsquo;re okay again. Life continues as normal, except that everything is different. The travel industry has plummeted into a deep, deep crisis. The end of the school year was bizarre, and we&amp;rsquo;re enjoying the Summer with walks in the park and watching television. Anticipating that my career might be ready for a change, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy applying for new jobs, and I just signed a new contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least we&amp;rsquo;re okay. People around us have been getting ill, severely ill, some of them dying. Working from home isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, specifically because we&amp;rsquo;ve turned our little shoebox of a living room into a two-person office, but we&amp;rsquo;re getting by. We have each other, and we have &lt;em&gt;Ratched&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2020/05/13/clobber/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://vineandfig.co/blog/2020/pray-tell-clobber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;originally published&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Vine &amp;amp; Fig &amp;ldquo;Pray Tell&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‘Hey dear!’ it sounds. ‘Happy Mother’s Day&amp;rsquo;, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again. The anniversary of his death is next week. Given the trajectory of my life, celebrating my mother’s parenting abilities seems ridiculous, but given the calendar, keeping a distance between us on this very day seems cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the daughter of my mother, I am two individuals. I am at once the person she wants to see, the one who overcame childhood troubles to arrive in adulthood a loving and supportive daughter. Also, though, I am the adult who just graduated from over two decades of therapy, someone who is active in those corners of Reddit where people go to discuss parental emotional abuse. My attachment to both of my parents is so disturbed that close contact is not really possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remind myself vaguely of my expat friends, the gay ones who came to Amsterdam to escape their queerphobic countries. When they talk on the phone with their parents, they have to ignore so many parts of their personality that they become other people. They don’t really have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do, at least, this much I’m told by the Catechism of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a good Catholic is someone who honors their father and mother. Sometimes, after working myself into a frenzy thinking about this, I research Catholic teachings on the healthy and God-loving child-parent relationship. My clobber passages are not the ones about queerness. They are those verses that tell me that children who don’t provide for their parents are worse than unbelievers. That it pleases HaShem when I obey my mother in everything. I don’t experience any spiritual rewards of peace and prosperity when I honor my parents the way the Bible (or society) teaches me. I experience the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Jews have the same teachings, you know&amp;rsquo; my favorite person will say. &amp;lsquo;Really?!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes, you&amp;hellip; stole our book, remember?&amp;rsquo; it will follow, jokingly but only because there&amp;rsquo;s truth in most jokes. Two things are true, she says. &amp;lsquo;One: biological parents aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones doing the parenting. Take Grandma Dora, for example. You always tell me how safe and welcome you felt in her home. Now that is a parent.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;And two?&amp;rsquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask, hopeful. &amp;lsquo;Two: it’s up to you to decide what constitutes honoring your parents. Either you can decide, or you can be miserable.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our friends gave birth to their first child, Eleanor! She was born on a trip east, and had to spend some time at the hospital. They sent us a wonderful photograph of her reaching out from her hospital crib. I simply &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to commemorate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon opening the jar of coconut oil (for cooking, hair, and skin care), right when my finger makes contact with what is too solid for comfort, I think of Iris and her graduation party, which was an utter calamity. Iris and I had attended kindergarten together, but it was by the grace of my cousin&amp;rsquo;s status as a pretty blonde girl that I even knew about any of the parties. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that it was a mistake for anybody to be there; at least for those who had received invitations to other parties. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell on which side of the pause my cousin belonged, but she had in her eyes the boredom of a person who has choices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s March&lt;/a&gt;. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t often attend protests, not in the last place because I&amp;rsquo;m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can&amp;rsquo;t be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Slept a little, had a midnight snack, went in for a bathroom break. Slept some more. Basically the life of a four-year-old&amp;rdquo; she says, and she tells me about her flight to Stockholm. She has been sleeping poorly lately; I say &amp;ldquo;lately&amp;rdquo; but I only met her last month, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what her sleep hygiene is, although she says &amp;ldquo;it has improved since I began falling asleep in your arms&amp;rdquo;. I imagine how she sleeps on the plane, entertaining the other passengers, cabin crew, and pilots with her stupefyingly loud snores.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In many ways, 2015 was a transformative year for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my soundtrack of 2015 is made up of party songs that played at the bars I used to frequent while I was living in Haarlem. The feelings invoked by some of these songs are entirely devoted to a particular crush I would have had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each song has the capacity to bring me back precisely to that period of time, in such a way that my body feels it. When everything seemed uncertain, rollercoaster-scary, and every fiber in me was yearning yearning yearning for whatever was perpetually out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interested in the actual songs? Check back later, while I work through my archive.)&lt;/p&gt;

            Confession
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2015/03/29/confession/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2015 14:59:23 -2900</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2015/03/29/confession/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I offered this confession as part of my confirmation into the 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://doopsgezindhaarlem.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Mennonite Church of Haarlem&lt;/a&gt;. While I recognize a few details that make me chuckle or cringe, much of what I believe today is reflected in the words below. At the time, I believed this church was the most at-home I would ever be able to feel at church. After I moved away to Amsterdam, and after years of being a spiritual nomad, I discovered 






  
  
  


  &lt;a href=&#34;https://zinzy.website/praxis&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;All Saints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told the warden a while ago that I was planning to enter into this community he said: &amp;ldquo;oh that&amp;rsquo;s great, you should definitely do that! Keep your confession short, though. Mine was 500 words.&amp;rdquo; That brevity doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so crazy. After all, what should one say, out loud at church, to God, one&amp;rsquo;s future brothers and sisters, ministers, friends, and family members to explain why one would call oneself a Christian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a confession is a matter to be lived out. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s thinking without doing? Or, as Dutch philosopher René Gude put it: &amp;ldquo;the crux is that you&amp;rsquo;re a Christian not if you know to confess it extensively with your big mouth, but if it makes you a funner person.&amp;rdquo; I ask for your forgiveness: this confession is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing this confirmation today with by my side my favorite story from the Book of Books: that of the Fall of Man. Before I tell you why original sin is such an important concept to me, you should know I take the Bible too seriously to take it literally. I&amp;rsquo;m not concerned with whether what&amp;rsquo;s in the Bible really happened. More important to me is the thought that it happens over and over again. Through time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Adam and Eve stole my heart. That naked man and woman hearing the very first law, breaking it without much contemplation, and — pardon my French — ruining the whole damn thing for the rest of us. Because they ate from the fruit, we people know the difference between good and evil. If you ask me and I answer honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you knowledge of good and evil is worse than evil itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental questions we can ask ourselves and each other is why evil exists at all. Why war? Why do sweet people die young? Why are people brought to doubt their humanity? Why did Eve pick the naughty option? Why did that snake have to be there at all? How powerful is evil, anyway? And if evil is there, does God control it? I thought God was good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of Genesis raises so many questions for me. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m studying Theology in university, I think about the story, and my program offers myriad tools to make sense of what happens in the book. But that, explaining God with logic until you think you know everything, is not what faith is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read about the Fall of Man and ask myself and God dozens of questions, I return over and over again to the most comforting thought I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had: I don&amp;rsquo;t get it, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure God does. There are really no words to talk about this story. And it&amp;rsquo;s a pure mystery, the experience it offers me. I can&amp;rsquo;t think about it properly, and I can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything with it. I can only &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where I encounter holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I connect myself with God. To mine, to yours, the God of the Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and all those people who don&amp;rsquo;t call God God but experience God anyway. To the One, the Eternal, the Everywhere-and-Always. To the God who enables us to find inspiration in the beautiful story of Jesus. The God who was, is, and becomes. Thanks to God I want to be in this community, together with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I know myself to be an adult here, letting myself be baptized as such. Because I can dwell and doubt here, forever, about the relationship between thinking, doing, and being. Because human eyes are looking at me here. Because I get to love the Bible here, but also give it a run for its money. Because, here, I get to think about what it means to practice Christian faith, and then do something about it. Because this place keeps showing me how easy it is to be a solid 21st-century church. And because, lastly, this place allows me to believe that the question mark is more important than the full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard someone compare it to the relationship between a parent and a child. I imagine a child wanting to create a birthday card for his mother, opting to draw her portrait on the cover. Does that child draw a lifelike portrait of his mother? No, but it sure is endearing. I just want to draw the most beautiful portrait I can with the colors I got from my Mother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas break is passing by me like it passes by an ambitious teenager. I greeted all the things I could do with great enthusiasm. Sadly, that feeling quickly turned into terror once I realised two weeks isn’t that long and I need to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity-wise, man can only fail under such conditions, this I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I keep being amazed by the weather in Haarlem. I managed to take some photos downtown last week that remind me of the beginning of September, despite a winter coat here and rain hat there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you ever happen to find yourself in the sleepy fishing town of IJmuiden: the fish, service, atmosphere, and cheesecake in the fish restaurant

It’s a great and easy read — a recommendation for anybody interested in the history of Christianity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vpro.nl/speel.program.27507738.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Son and the Stranger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a beautiful Dutch-language documentary about Daan, a man who, after studying Hebrew in university, converted to the ultra orthodox Jewish faith. Filmmaker Thomas Vroege attempts to understand his motives.&lt;/li&gt;

With a comeback from &lt;em&gt;7th Heaven&lt;/em&gt;‘s youngest daughter. Totally worth the choke by laughter, though.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly handy and simple, it has turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember those times when you were at the store, and as your mother went about her shopping, you were attracting attention to your little self by doing something foolish, bringing soft smiles to all the surrounding adults, except for this one asshole? I have a growing suspicion that I am that person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list of things I truly have no opinion on. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I have a negative opinion and I&amp;rsquo;m just sugarcoating it by saying I don&amp;rsquo;t have one. These are things of which, when I think about them, I am baffled to know they don&amp;rsquo;t trigger any form of criticism or evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goldfish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enya&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shawshank Redemption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Alpes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gangnam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard towels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drug trafficking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tacos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney World&lt;/li&gt;

            On keeping a journal
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/31/on-keeping-a-journal/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -3100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/31/on-keeping-a-journal/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The only journal I’ve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with my offline photo journalling habit was that I could never enjoy looking at my photos. There were no visuals to support my Finder, and I loved seeing them come together when arranged in a certain way. So, for approximately five years I didn’t really look at any of the photographs I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a tiny new chapter opens up with the birth of a new website dedicated to these photographs. I’m in the process of selecting the ones I love most from 2005-now, and publishing them in a horizontal fashion. They’re relatively small, always have to be seen in relation to each other, and are created by a collection of cameras. They were taken for a number of reasons; many for clients, but even more for my personal gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now the website is located at 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;http://zinzygeene.tumblr.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, but that will most likely change to a more personalized address. I’m contemplating using &lt;em&gt;zinzygeene.nl&lt;/em&gt;, which I think is always a joke when it comes to a serious portfolio website, or another one I have registered. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken it down because I can&amp;rsquo;t get over Tumblr&amp;rsquo;s problem with ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

            Sounds of home
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/29/sounds-of-home/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -2900</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/29/sounds-of-home/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I swiped through my digital September issue of Wired, I came across a bit that immediately swung me back right into my first year of high school. Presented on the page where a Nokia 3310, a 56k modem, a Dot-matrix printer, a Tube TV, and a Speak &amp;amp; Spell. It was a piece about the Museum of Endangered Sounds, a digital archive of sounds we all remember so, so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super geek Brendan Chilcutt (the nom de plume used by the collective who founded the museum), fearfully wonders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the entire world has adopted devices with sleek, silent touch interfaces, where will we turn for the sound of fingers striking QWERTY keypads? Tell me that. And tell me: Who will play my GameBoy when I&amp;rsquo;m gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the website multiple times during the day, and I hope it&amp;rsquo;ll stay live for a long time to come. The quality of the sounds is impeccable, and it really gets you back into that mood of being relaxed, or slightly terrified about something as cute as a pop quiz, or a boyfriend who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call, or not having that cool phone with a personalized cover. I  I had a box I could fill, keep in the closet and open up whenever things were getting gloomy and I wanted to be close to Grandma Dora, here&amp;rsquo;s what sounds I&amp;rsquo;d put inside it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rotary-dial-telephone&#34;&gt;The rotary dial telephone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me off the phone my old friend Leonne gave me. It used to belong to her grandmother, but she wanted me to have it. I placed it in my room and felt incredibly proud, because I was the only one I knew who owned such a beautifully old device. What I enjoy remembering is the fact that I hardly ever got a single caller asking for me, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my own landline. I spent many hours eavesdropping on my Mom and her friends having boring conversations about nothing important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-floppy-disk&#34;&gt;The floppy disk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the time in December of 1999 when Pokémon Red and Blue had just come out. Every kid in my school wanted the games, and most of them wanted a Game Boy so they could play them. I already had a Game Boy, I had been addicted to Tetris and Super Mario Land for years. But my mother refused to get me the games. Luckily, my cousin&amp;rsquo;s cousin Ben, a notorious local nerd, had managed to get me two floppy editions for free. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the disks out very often (I was always playing the games), but I clearly remember that very first time I ever heard a floppy disk up close, when I put in Pokémon Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tetris&#34;&gt;Tetris&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the attic, or under my bed, playing the game until my thumbs got sore and I actually had repetitive strain injury. And to this day, if I can get my hands on the game (I&amp;rsquo;ve refused to download the iPad version), I will not say a word for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tamagotchi&#34;&gt;The Tamagotchi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sour one for me. Because, while I loved my Tamagotchi in the beginning, I ended up hating its guts. In the late nineties, every single kid in my school had one. I loved taking care of something, the cute sounds it produced and the flashy colour of the case. We were inseperable. But then came 1998, and with it the motherfucking Furby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furby was brought on the market right before Christmas (cheeky bastards), and some of my richer friends (five of the six girls in my group, I was the other one) had a Furby. So, my Tamagotchi and I remained friends as the other girls hung out at the park with their furbies, having tea parties in pink sweaters and SHUT UP. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

            Misanthropy anew
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/11/misanthropy-anew/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -1100</pubDate>
        <guid>https://zinzy.website/2012/08/11/misanthropy-anew/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I would love to have another life, just so I could spend it cursing at everything, and everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative character of this man is self-evident. He&amp;rsquo;s as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories. It makes hanging out with him a free afternoon at a comedy club. His lifestyle is perfectly suited for his disposition. I&amp;rsquo;m positive his house contains more rooms than even he can count. There is a room for his art, another one for the art his students produce, various studios, six bathrooms, and three separate kitchens. He lives alone where he is boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is also much older than I am, think a young grandfather. I expect that his age plays a large part in how comfortable he is low-key hating everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m not so lucky. Whenever I find myself muttering that &amp;ldquo;I hate people&amp;rdquo;, my self-talk quickly turns to shame and guilt. What if mankind is, in fact, nice, and I just happen to not see it? What if all those people on trains producing noises that make me want to explode would happily carry on a conversation with me, if only I was open to some fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think it would be incredible to have a door in my house, one that only I have the key to. It opens to a world exactly like this, except that nobody there can hear me scream and curse. I would hang out there on occasion, using profanity so profane that Satan would eventually have to come in to please ask me to simmer down because I was offending all the racist, nazi pedophiles in the hottest, darkest corners of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t so much that I am mad at anyone specific, but more so the earth as a whole with everything and everyone on it, including myself. Or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not even mad, but rather afraid? I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s where anger sometimes comes from, right? Maybe if I take a pillow and shout into it really loudly, and then go back to doing whatever,

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the deal with people and coffee? No, let&amp;rsquo;s try that again. What is the deal with people and dish water? Coffee&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these days. Is. Disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Starbucks recently opened in Utrecht, and to celebrate the occassion, a dear friend of mine, whom I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in two years, suggested we meet there for a pumpkin spiced whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat, I&amp;rsquo;d love to buy a middle finger. Or else perhaps just a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe for Real Coffee is available upon request&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can remember what was taught in my Applied Linguistics class by the shirt my professor wore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My biggest secret is an unending fascination for the 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momversation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;Momversation&lt;/a&gt; in which mommy bloggers discuss motherhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people in my Dutch Language and Culture program are bad at spelling. All of them want to be writers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times a day I realize I probably don&amp;rsquo;t want kids: 17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of failing University. During the day I&amp;rsquo;m scared, and when I&amp;rsquo;m not scared, I&amp;rsquo;m asleep. I&amp;rsquo;m a 4.5 GPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I miss Frédérique Huydts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual occasions that prompt a re-reading of &lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones&amp;rsquo; Diary&lt;/em&gt;: birthday and New Year&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li&gt;

            Considerations
          
        </title>
        <link>https://zinzy.website/2009/09/27/considerations/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother&amp;rsquo;s cousins&amp;rsquo; daughters&amp;rsquo; coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s a change of strategy, and of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on. No more updates on my general well-being, college achievements, and peculiar trains of thought. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s enough happening, but the focus isn&amp;rsquo;t where it should be: on a white piece of paper. Instead of feeling shame about my lack of commitment, I will simply change the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were you, I would adjust my expectations for this particular website: pictures without explanations, cryptic musings, things I like, things I wish to remember, and sometimes the old blog post. Or a combination of all of the above, or something entirely different. You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry.
Love you too.&lt;/p&gt;

            School supplies

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing was never my strong suit. I could stand there for hours, by the neatly arranged tables of school supplies. After all, they would have to last me the entire school year. The right supplies, this I figured, would lead to the right achievements. I was so young back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year after year I&amp;rsquo;d find myself biking to town in the Summer months. Cover paper, new pencils, a nice fountain pen, snazzy fineliners. Preferably all the things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I went to shop for new supplies. I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting my freshman year of university, after a one-year hiatus. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made a list, I figured a veteran like me could do without it on a trip like this. As soon as I&amp;rsquo;d get to the store, all the requirements would come to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I was keen on finding was a four-subject notebook, one for each course. And after that? Well, that was about it. I did already have a pencil case. And a fountain pen. And pencils. And binders. And a backpack. And a diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home I went, with a teeny tiny plastic bag and two A5 notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nine years, I realize I have everything I need. I no longer believe I need certain things to achieve my goals. Now it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of doing the work, with everything I need just within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p&gt;

            On the misfortunes of yesterday

        <link>https://zinzy.website/2009/08/01/on-the-misfortunes-of-yesterday/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled &amp;ldquo;DYKES!&amp;rdquo; at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike such 






  
  
  

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34; after:content-[&#39; ↗&#39;] &#34;&gt;antics&lt;/a&gt; as much as the next gay. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the words &amp;ldquo;dyke&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fag&amp;rdquo; and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we&amp;rsquo;re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me. My choice to walk hand in hand with N, and not Nicholas. I rarely encounter homophobia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, I don&amp;rsquo;t look like a lesbian. It&amp;rsquo;s a personal choice: I&amp;rsquo;m also Dutch, half African, an inhabitant of Eindhoven, married to reading, writing, and books, and in love with Anohni&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from that band. If I were to express all of those identities, I might as well start wishing I turn into a float tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m annoyed with is the fact that yesterday, I saw 300 different stereotyped people pass me in the street, and I somehow managed to keep my mouth shut to all of them. Because I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about other people&amp;rsquo;s feelings. Because we live IN THE NETHERLANDS, damnit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know, I think about things, and I know the insecure, angry, Moroccan teenager is not to blame. After all, I&amp;rsquo;m sure he&amp;rsquo;s had a few insults hurled at him, and he was just reciprocating this civil friendliness. This experience reminds me I don&amp;rsquo;t live in a country that fully accepts the life I live. Whichever way you look at it, emancipation in the gay scene isn&amp;rsquo;t as omnipresent as we think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because today is the Day of Days, and some people are on their tenth sangria dancing on a boat in thong underwear, I think it&amp;rsquo;s only fitting to think about what a multicultural and diverse country such as the Netherlands is really doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are gay people more emancipated than the San Francisco of the 70s? Or do the near-naked protests, gay gyms, gay saunas, gay stores, gay parties, gay travel agencies find ways to work against us? Is the gap between straight people and gay people bigger than we care to admit? Are we still asking whether &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; fit into &amp;ldquo;your&amp;rdquo; world and vice versa, or is there finally space to start talking about &amp;ldquo;our&amp;rdquo; world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; want to fit into &amp;ldquo;your&amp;rdquo; world — which I think we&amp;rsquo;ve already been doing for decades, just to the inattentiveness of some — is it smart of gay people to seclude ourselves to spaces designed for people like us? When one lesbian says &amp;ldquo;hey dyke&amp;rdquo; to another, it&amp;rsquo;s a term of endearment. But if a straight girl or, even better, a Moroccan boy, says the term casually near a gay person, we call it discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m for emancipation, and against exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here writing this instead of celebrating Gay Pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? I know it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult subject, but please keep it civil in the comments. Constructive criticism, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m aware that Anohni went by a different name when this post was written, but I avoid

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say to my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s grandparents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My result for that &amp;ldquo;What religion are you?&amp;rdquo; quiz gave me a 4% match with Catholicism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result was the same for your girlfriend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I&amp;rsquo;d say if I had 15 minutes of airtime on Dutch television and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to account for my actions later:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the singers are great, your talent show is just really, really dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Herd behavior is the first phase of personal decay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted Obama to win for the most obvious reason, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t Bush or the war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People I&amp;rsquo;d love to give that one last push to make them fall hard in life:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anne Hathaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That deranged Jesus guy riding around on a mobility scooter all over town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That one roommate who barfed all over the bathroom floor and didn&amp;rsquo;t clean it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books I&amp;rsquo;m glad I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jill Mansell&amp;rsquo;s body of work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/em&gt; by Elizabeth Gilbert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreamcatcher&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen King&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicknames I currently have on rotation for myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean Ya Teetha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zinzy Dorens van der Mellencamp Huizenbroeksteren&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ice Z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
