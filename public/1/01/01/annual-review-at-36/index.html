  <p>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could&rsquo;ve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say &ldquo;adult&rdquo; but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.</p>
