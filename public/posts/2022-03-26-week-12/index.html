        <p>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we&rsquo;re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you &ldquo;leave it cleaner than you found it&rdquo; and make sure you&rsquo;re gone after two days. At this point, we&rsquo;re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining &ldquo;Bonsoihoir&rdquo;. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, &ldquo;no, not for champagne, just for the drinks&rdquo;. I also really don&rsquo;t like ticks, and I simply can&rsquo;t imagine that Norway somehow doesn&rsquo;t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve begun hosting dinner parties again. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022421-bulgogi-eggplant">Eggplant bulgogi</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/">roasted squash with soy-glazed gingery tofu</a> make for a great Asian fusion. With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.</p>
<p>At work, I&rsquo;m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I&rsquo;m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I&rsquo;ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite&rsquo;s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn&rsquo;t even think of it myself.</p>
<p>On Sunday I watched a few horror films, <em>Midsommar</em> being the favorite. I also watched <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2022), which wasn&rsquo;t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of <em>Killing Eve</em>, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin r√©sum√© aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.</p>
