<li>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year.</li>
<li>After two weeks of cocooning, we&rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see she&rsquo;s such a relaxed and curious dog.</li>
<li>This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I don&rsquo;t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and I&rsquo;m grateful I was able to take this time off.</li>
<li>I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; to &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, don&rsquo;t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like I&rsquo;m not a proper Christian. Regardless, it&rsquo;s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.</li>
<li>Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didn&rsquo;t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Here&rsquo;s to hoping they&rsquo;ll become best friends.</li>
<li><a href="https://anneliewambeek.com">Annelie</a> came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. She&rsquo;s Lemonade&rsquo;s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.</li>
<li>Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. She&rsquo;s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. I&rsquo;m proud of her.</li>
