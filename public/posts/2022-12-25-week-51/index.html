<li>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate!</li>
<li>Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said &ldquo;where are the tea lights?&rdquo;, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don&rsquo;t mind that we didn&rsquo;t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</li>
<li>This week was all about the new piano I bought. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking or talking about it.</li>
<li>All I&rsquo;ll say is: this piano project is the first one I&rsquo;m approaching through a neurodiverse lens, and it&rsquo;s making everything <em>so</em> much smoother and funner.</li>
<li>Illegally, I&rsquo;m mentioning something that happened in week 50. A. took me for my annual Fancy Birthday Dinner. For the first time since we began dating, I told her to leave it a surprise. I suppose it&rsquo;s one of those benefits of having gone to in-patient eating disorder treatment: chill vibes about food surprises. If you ever have an appetite for exquisite 10-course Asian fusion dining, book a table at <a href="https://101gowrie.com/">101 Gowrie</a>, where the atmosphere is as beautiful as the tableware, the bread is to cry over, and the umami is so intense that you&rsquo;ll have trouble putting it into words.</li>
<li>We needed a two-nighter to finish watching <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. I&rsquo;m very much at that point in my mid-thirties where finishing a feature film under a warm blanket on the sofa after 8 p.m. is a challenge. I love whodunits — the genre might be in my top three — but I was quite disappointed to learn that both A. and I were able to guess the ending within the first five minutes. Janelle Monáe and Kathryn Hahn looked great nonetheless.</li>
<li>All week, people kept asking me what I&rsquo;d be doing for Christmas, and I&rsquo;d cheerfully reply &ldquo;Nothing! You?&rdquo; every time. I feel liberated from the pressure to spend time with family or friends during the holidays, to eat more than I can carry, and to <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> fun. We certainly did have fun, just in a &ldquo;really couldn&rsquo;t be bothered&rdquo; kind of way.</li>
<li>I made my first batch of heavenly mud, a rich, creamy chocolate dessert. It was heavenly.</li>
