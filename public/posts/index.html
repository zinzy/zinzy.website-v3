      <p>I&rsquo;ve long admired the ways in which German culture had learnt to grapple with WW2. It instilled me with hope that humans can learn from their mistakes, and that looking at a problem is more effective than looking away from it. Your post vibrates in the same frequency.</p>

      <p>Thanks for providing a quick summary of Cal&rsquo;s video. Saved me a watch. At first glance, his idea resonates immediately, particularly the concept of the infinite buffer. I suppose it&rsquo;s not difficult to get lost trying to distinguish this buffer from the cybernetic tools we use to populate it.</p>

      <ul>
<li>This week marked the week I got back into the swing of things at work. I tend to find the holiday season quite boring because things slow down quite a bit. Now that people are returning from their winter break, my to do list is filling up again with exciting projects, opportunities for collaboration, and research endeavors. As usual, a conversation with my manager reminded me how much I love my job.</li>
<li>I finished Angela Davis&rsquo; <em>[[Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (2015)|Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (2015)]]</em> and read a few chapters of <em>[[Out There Screaming: An Anthology of New Black Horror (2023)|Out There Screaming: An Anthology of New Black Horror (2023)]]</em>. I had forgotten how much I love gothic horror. Echoes of Carmen Maria Machado&rsquo;s <em>[[Her Body and Other Parties (2017)|Her Body and Other Parties (2017)]]</em> were in my head as a result all week.</li>
<li>I also began reading [[Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)|Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)]] again after first picking it up last Summer. It&rsquo;s a special book, one I&rsquo;ll return to again and again I&rsquo;m sure.</li>
<li>In 2023, my Wednesdays at the office varied from busy to overwhelming: lots of interactions, many meetings, few moments to myself. By the time Bible study came around at 6:30, I was ready for bed. The Wednesday this week was radically different: I had very few meetings, got to concentrate on my task list, and I attended my first [[Omek|Omek]] accountability circle event. I found Omek, a community for people from the African diaspora, in the Autumn of 2023, and immediately considered it too good to be true. I found out this week that it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s actually a community of Black people from all over the world, all professionals at various stages in their career, and many of them live in Amsterdam. The accountability circle had me eat a desk lunch. <em>and</em> check off a large portion of what I had been looking to accomplish during the entire week. Awesome.</li>
<li>Our dear friend AR from Stockholm came to stay at our place because she was attended a weekend-long dance workshop in Amsterdam. Five minutes with her and I remember there&rsquo;s an entire portion of myself that I don&rsquo;t tap into enough. Our conversations flow flawlessly, as if the last time we spoke wasn&rsquo;t three years ago. I appreciate the depth we so easily reach, the air that I feel around myself, my relationships, my choices. We spend three evenings over candlelight, talking about work, family, love, trust, faith, Judaism, the war, and so much more.</li>
<li>Another great thing about Wednesday was that I had the energy to attend Bible study, which started out small with the usual suspects, and became something different altogether when two other queer people of color showed up. They didn&rsquo;t even realize there was only one straight person at the table until later. It was a very sweet experience to hear about their journeys. I hope I&rsquo;ll see them again. We talked about the part in John when <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A42-51&amp;version=NIV">Jesus calls Philip and Nathanael</a> and it made me think about feeling seen, wholly.</li>
<li>On Saturday, I had the good fortune of meeting NB, a person I met at Omek. Over chicken and waffles we got to meet each other and it felt like we were old friends. It&rsquo;s <em>spectacular</em> to hear about the experiences of a Black person who grew up in a white environment.</li>
<li>Nice IndieWeb discovery this week: <a href="https://rachsmith.com/">Rachel Smith</a>.</li>

      <ul>
<li>A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee.</li>
<li>I seem to have found my way back to the [[Miracle morning|Miracle morning]] method. While I cringe at the very notion of self development, it has been great to start my day in quietude.</li>
<li>Lemonade did really well on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and while I think she would&rsquo;ve been fine sleeping in her crate in the loving room, we let her sleep on the bed. We&rsquo;re now people whose dog sleeps on their bed. Another benefit to this, besides cuddles, is that it gives me the living room to wake up calmly.</li>
<li>I spent my winter break walking serious distances in the city, and now that I&rsquo;m back to work the rush of my calendar (even when it was mostly empty this week) made it so that I didn&rsquo;t really go on a single urban hike.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been making a bigger effort to practice the [[Law of two feet|Law of two feet]], and much to my amusement it gives me so much more headspace.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re continuing our <em>[[Better Call Saul (2015-2022)|Better Call Saul (2015-2022)]]</em> journey, which, mid-way through season 2, seems to find itself in a bit of a legal lull. I wonder if it&rsquo;ll change. I wonder if I&rsquo;ll continue watching if it doesn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve set a reading challenge on Goodreads this year, and this week I&rsquo;m already down 1, 25 more to go. I&rsquo;ve discovered that non-fiction audio books work well for me.</li>
<li>On Friday, we had farewell drinks for AN. I&rsquo;m quite sad to see him go. He and I both have golden retriever energy, and it was always a bit of a homecoming to be at the office with him.</li>
<li>On Saturday, I went to Coppenhagen for new beads. I&rsquo;ve been looking for excuses to make more rosaries, and I decided I&rsquo;ll make one for each liturgical color.</li>

      <p>Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think</em>, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, and <em>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</em> are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-design-books-guide">Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://start.uxdesign.cc/">The Guide to Design</a> by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point</li>

      <h3 id="covid">Covid</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. Despite a <a href="/2023/11/19/week-46">negative test</a>, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I&rsquo;m not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.</p>
<p>Later in the week, I have cabin fever that is so intense it makes me cry in the park a little bit. On Sunday, the only thing I&rsquo;m left with is a stuffy nose as well as some fatigue. God, I hope I don&rsquo;t develop long Covid.</p>
<h3 id="consuming">Consuming</h3>
<p>Anja and I watch season two of <em>Somebody Somewhere</em>. It makes me regain a new appreciation for Bridget Everett&rsquo;s physical comedy, new sincerity, and sass. I wish she and I were friends.</p>
<h3 id="tinkering">Tinkering</h3>
<p>I make some changes to my website this week, centering a page of text with links on the homepage. Sometimes, I feel bad that I don&rsquo;t take screenshots every time I change it. But I suppose my continuous redesign strategy prevents that from being realistic.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the country has her very own 2016 American election result: after 20 years of being (rightfully) ridiculed as a far right party, PVV is finally the biggest, taking 37 of 150 seats in the House. Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I&rsquo;ve spoken with are gobsmacked. Party leader Geert Wilders has become Geert Milders. A part of me is angry and sad, but a much larger part says: welcome to my world.</p>

      <ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I&rsquo;ve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week?</li>
<li>I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing. The various spaces we saw were tailored to what life must have been like when the elderly clients were younger: a fifties barber shop, a diner-like restaurant. It was endearing. More professionally, I continue to be stunned by the working lives of people in healthcare. Having to balance tight budgets and strict schedules on the one hand and genuinely wanting the best for clients on the other is not an easy feat.</li>
<li>It seems like I did pick up Covid while there.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve begun watching <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em> and I love my life. The farther I become removed from the humanities major version of myself, the easier it becomes to admit I love monster disaster stories.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also begun watching the second season of <em>The Morning Show</em>, and two episodes in I understand why Anja urged me to really, <em>really</em> give it a try. Reese Witherspoon making out with Julianna Margulies is not the stuff of dreams I thought I needed, but here we are. Acting, storyline etc. also good.</li>
<li>The Israel-Hamas War continues to rage, which has begun to feel like a weird name for the conflict. I wonder what it means that, when I Google those words, the Wikipedia entry to which I&rsquo;m directed is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel">
2023 Hamas attack on Israel</a>.</li>
<li>I will never have first-hand experience of what it means to be a Jewish person in the world today, although I&rsquo;ve been having a second-hand experience that has been leaving me&hellip; perturbed. When people discover my partner is Jewish, the tone of the conversation shifts. Not in a pro-Palestinian way, but in the way Jenna Maroney felt the urge to touch Liz Lemon&rsquo;s hand after learning that Liz had met Oprah on a flight (which, of course, turned out to be a random Black woman).</li>
<li>While I tested negative, I did spend Friday evening and night in bed with a fever and a body that felt as though it had been hit by a truck. Anja did test positive on Sunday, and so now we&rsquo;re quarantining. March 2020 all over again.</li>
<li>I keep thinking a lot about Osama Bin Laden. About the lack of context given by the journalist who shared parts of his <em>Letter to the American people</em> on social media. How TikTok and X, at least for a moment, were rife with people who were barely born when 9/11 happened, proclaiming support for Bin Laden because he had pro-Palestinian things to say. About the importance of digital literacy in the classroom.</li>
<li>Whenever I&rsquo;m ill, I bake or cook. I feel bad not doing anything and lying in bed all day, and following a recipe always seems like a good way to pass the time. This week, I made apple crumble custard <em>vlaai</em>. You can take the girl out of Limburg (and thank God for that), but&hellip;</li>

    <content>
      <p>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea#Criticism">&ldquo;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&rdquo;</a>. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.</p>
<p>I was there for four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>My definition of God is &ldquo;science is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her&rdquo;</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment</li>
<li>I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands">Dutch carnival season</a> had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade</li>
</ol>
<p>The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman. Still, I appreciate that its most vicious context of use taints it so ferociously with antisemitism that deploying it as a vehicle for unity is a recipe for disaster. The crowd was so immense that it took hours of dancing in place before we even got started on the route. By the time we got to Museum Square, the words had already left the woman&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>We got there just in time to watch Greta Thunberg, who had been marching with us, turning her face away from cameras to remind us of why she was there. In between her on the stage and us on the field there were three screens, each projecting her face from a distance. I <em>believe</em> she was there, but the crowd was too big to say anything with much certainty.</p>
<p>My activist friend is one of those rare white people: privileged enough to belong to the 1% of a <em>variety</em> of subgroups, yet so antiracist it brings a tear to your eye. A seeker of nuance and complexity. A political unicorn. As we stood in the longest line I had ever seen, sharing the weight of a &ldquo;THE CRISIS IS NOW&rdquo; banner, I said to her: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so&hellip; White here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, mildly embarrassed it seemed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s actually a huge problem for us that we could use some help with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, there was a peculiar detail to the way I engaged with other people of color. I didn&rsquo;t. There was no nod in the street, no tribe to which I belonged, no &ldquo;our stories of minority and loneliness resonate&rdquo;. Color blindness was the tune, and we were dancing to it. After almost a decade in Amsterdam I&rsquo;ve come to consider this lack of acknowledgement poor behavior. There&rsquo;s not a black person in the neighborhood I don&rsquo;t know. I had forgotten my life wasn&rsquo;t always like this, until yesterday. I counted no more than ten people of color in the crowd, and I exchanged looks with not a single one of them.</p>
<p>Whenever I find myself in a sea of vast whiteness, I ask myself: &ldquo;where am I, why are there no other people of color here, and should I <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/"><em>Get Out</em></a>?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love white people. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">Some of my best friends are white people.</a> My <em>wife</em> is a white person. Consider it a habit I&rsquo;ve developed growing up in the Netherlands, where nothing about ethnicity is quite as it seems.</p>
<p>What solidifies Greta Thunberg&rsquo;s identity as a Zoomer is the radical solidarity she and her contemporaries practice, seemingly without effort. Once she finally got on stage, her first act of compassion was to return the word to the Palestinian woman whose sound had been disconnected immediately after she had said the phrase.</p>
<p>What followed is what you may expect to happen when a person traumatized by an active war has to find it in herself to pick up where she left off to tell 85,000 mostly white faces how climate justice and justice for Palestine can exist on the same stage.</p>
<p>It was <em>mayhem</em>.</p>
<p>Once Greta had the mic again, she decided to keep her speech brief, much to the dismay I&rsquo;m sure of all the people who felt blessed to share a moment in Amsterdam with her. Not <em>so</em> brief, however, that a man couldn&rsquo;t walk on stage and declare he was there for the climate and not for politics.</p>
<p>The respectability politics are vile today. All I can think about is the power of the speech that could have been. The one in which a Palestinian woman addresses a vast sea of white faces who all listen intently to her talk about climate change. The way she says the words &ldquo;river&rdquo; and &ldquo;sea&rdquo; only when referring to natural bodies of water. The way she captivates her audience until the very end, when she pulls a Hannah Gadsby to remind us all of the hypocrisy and dangers of compartmental solidarity. The way she nods quietly to the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>The respectability politics are vile today. March-induced feelings of disappointment, uninspired virtue signalling, and racism find each other. A discombobulated display of on-stage pain and the very notion of pro-Palestinian sentiment have quickly been conflated into a rhetoric with which I feel increasingly uncomfortable: that people in power decide when minorities speak about their place in the world. That, when we talk about climate justice, every other topic must give way. That, when we march for a cause that seems to predominantly attract white people, unwritten rules of radical inclusion don&rsquo;t apply. I feel the climate activism community interviewed for a job with me, and as a result I want to burn its r√©sum√©.</p>
<p>It makes me sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad because there are people who think climate justice can exist outside of politics. I&rsquo;m sad because so many people don&rsquo;t understand that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political">the personal is political</a>. I&rsquo;m sad because I want to engage in climate activism, but I don&rsquo;t feel there&rsquo;s a place for me at the table. I&rsquo;m sad because, right now, climate activism feels like a Gutmensch hobby. I&rsquo;m sad for all the people who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. I&rsquo;m sad for our Uncle Eli from Tel Aviv who is in and out of his bomb shelter all day.</p>

    <content>
      <p><em>I delivered this sermon today at <a href="http://allsaintsamsterdam.church/">All Saints Amsterdam</a>.</em></p>
<p>A few months ago, along with much of humanity, it seemed, I went to see <em>Barbie</em>. Walking out of the theatre and forming an opinion on this intro to feminism, I renamed the film to a title which I will use again today: &ldquo;Blueprints: a pamphlet against simplicity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see all of your faces here today. I&rsquo;ve met most of you before, but let me make an official introduction. My name is Zinzy, I&rsquo;m 35 years old, I live in Amsterdam, and I work in the tech industry. I&rsquo;m an interaction designer at a medical technology company, which is to say that I design the ways in which doctors and nurses interact with my company&rsquo;s software. My job is to find out how we can improve the lives of essential workers. It involves a lot of research, empathizing, and imagining. The phrase I repeat over and over again is: &ldquo;How might we&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When people ask me how I came to have such a cool job, I always tell them about my degree in Comparative Literature, and the time I spent studying Theology. It never fails to throw them off. After all, what could be further apart than the literary canon and the abracadabra I do at work all day?</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, really, I just love a good story. I love looking at the ways in which we attempt to make sense of the world around us as well as the world within us. I like stories because of what they say about us. I like stories because we use them in our attempts to humanize others. The truest and sweetest opinion I have on humans is that we are storytelling animals.</p>
<p>When we tell a story, we take a reality (fictional or non-fictional), weave together its most important events and actors, and have our audience look at them through the eyes of one or more entities. To tell a story is an act of selection, of extraction from the truth what we deem important. To tell a story is to curate reality. To tell a story is to shape the world. We turn something complex into vehicles for education, entertainment, action. We abstract from <em>what is</em>, so our shared language is easy to comprehend.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Here are two stories about Jesus. One. God has a Son who is also God, he is perfect, and we will never be as good as him, but let‚Äôs try. Two. There was a baby born in humility, who grew up to be an inspiration to billions. He was murdered because people thought he was evil, but we never forgot his name. Two stories that invoke entirely different responses. Two stories that remind us that the storyteller is the one who holds the power.</p>
<p>Today, the story we&rsquo;re telling each other is that of Christian saints. When Mpho suggested I preach about this, my thought process brought me from Mother Teresa via &ldquo;oh-oh, I am certainly going to screw this up&rdquo; to the most important commandment in the tech industry: ask why before you ask how.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, let me tell you what I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do today. I can&rsquo;t do is tell you how I think reliving the stories of saints will get us into the Kingdom of Heaven. I can&rsquo;t even tell you about my favorite saint, because I don&rsquo;t have one. What I <em>can</em> do is share with you what I have: questions. Questions about questions. Questions about stories. Lots and lots of questions. Today, I hold onto what I know, how to build successful technology, to wade into what I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Saints. &ldquo;These are the ones coming out of great tribulation&rdquo; the lessons tell us. Throughout the centuries, first informally and locally, and then because Popes began restricting to themselves the right to canonize, we&rsquo;ve collected hundreds upon hundreds of saints. Apostles, martyrs, confessors. Human beings who were perceived to have an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God.</p>
<p>And today, still, many of us find inspiration in the stories about these people. They&rsquo;re exemplary models, extraordinary teachers, wonder workers. They&rsquo;re intercessors through whom we pray. Their stories are designed to inspire us into devotion, into serving God day and night in God&rsquo;s temple, which is the world. When I think of it, saints <em>are</em> stories. After all, we never get the full picture, just what we&rsquo;ve chosen is relevant enough to repeat.</p>
<p>These stories fall perfectly in step with the rhythm of Christianity, the rhythm of the Western world. The rhythm of looking for what we could have and could be. What we don&rsquo;t have, and what we are not. Yet. We live in a culture of becoming. A culture, and a religion, of harder, better, faster, stronger. A culture of progression. Saints were designed to propel us towards the next best thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no different from the culture in which I grew up: I love progress. I love growth, I love my learner&rsquo;s mentality. I love that we use the saintly canon, a set of stories we&rsquo;ve chosen to prioritize, to be better tomorrow than we are today. But there&rsquo;s a flip side.</p>
<p>I struggle.</p>
<p>I struggle with saints, with how our tradition has curated, abstracted their human realities. I struggle with the fact that this is an effect of storytelling <em>at all</em>. I struggle with what happens when details go missing, when nuance is lost. I struggle with how, without details and nuance, we idealize as quickly as we devalue. The absence of details turn excellent <em>Harry Potter</em> books into pretty ok <em>Harry Potter</em> movies. It turns Mary Teresa, a sweet, charitable nun with questionable opinions on the realities of sexual violence in the Catholic church, into the pinnacle of female selflessness. It turns inhabitants of Gaza into terrorists. It turns Judaism into the root of all evil.</p>
<p>The art of storytelling is a sharp, double-edged sword. And I want to learn how to handle it more carefully, both as a speaker and as a listener.</p>
<p>I struggle with how stories about saints make us compare our insides to other people&rsquo;s outsides. Even the word &ldquo;saint&rdquo; itself doesn&rsquo;t necessarily invoke an atmosphere of reaching for the attainable. I struggle with this the same way I struggle with Beyonc√©, who, at 23, won her first Grammy, an age at which I took five weeks to find the best typeface for my bachelor thesis.</p>
<p>I struggle with how I can&rsquo;t see myself in the saints. And I need to see myself in someone to learn from them. As a queer person of color, I am intimately familiar with what it means when I can&rsquo;t see myself in people. It invokes a sense of otherness, not a sense of community and hope. Color me a Christian millennial, but I learn from <em>mistakes</em>, not from other people&rsquo;s highlight reels.</p>
<p>I know that, when it comes to the differences between veneration, adoration, admiration, idolatry, and worship, the Catechism of the Catholic Church will tell you I&rsquo;m doing it wrong. I think that&rsquo;s just her modus operandi. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m doing it wrong. I think there&rsquo;s a flaw in the interaction design of how we&rsquo;ve been taught to grow.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: you are not enough, other people are, and you should feel inspired to be more like them. Inspired by Jesus, Mother Teresa, St. Augustine, Beyonce, Stephen Hawking, Barbie, the Barbie, the resistance fighters. I don&rsquo;t need a superhuman who can show me how to become more like them. I need a lifetime of flaws to remind me how to be a better me because someone else became a better them.</p>
<p>As a designer, I will forever defend the right of a design flaw to exist. In fact, if we ignore the design flaw, we&rsquo;ll never be able to make things better. We must look at the problem before we come up with a solution. We must ask why before we ask how.</p>
<p>Why <em>might</em> we become better? And then:</p>
<p><em>How</em> might we use stories in a way that retains our individuality, our dignity, and leaves a margin for error, and room for doubt? How might we let the saints, all the names in the Bible, the very humans they were, inspire us to see ourselves in each other without concluding that we fail to imitate the blueprint?</p>
<p>How might we become better co-humans so that the Kingdom of Heaven is what we refer to when we say &ldquo;wow, that was a really happy moment for me&rdquo;? How might we do unto others as we would have them do unto us? How might we remember that <em>that</em> is the entire law, and the rest is just commentary?</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <ul>
<li>First of all: not a great week. I continue to struggle to notice when I feel stresed or overwhelmed, and it never fails to result in my body giving me a clear sign. On Monday evening, in the midst of a busy work month, my body said &ldquo;SIT. DOWN.&rdquo; I needed undtil well into the weekend to feel myself again.</li>
<li>One of the signs my body knows to give it a very mild version of conversion disorder: I lose the ability to listen to a conversation while I walk without feeling very dizzy. Isn&rsquo;t the body a beautiful, very annoying, but magnificent thing?</li>
<li>I start back up at work on Thursday, working the mornings until the weekend. It&rsquo;s good to acknowledge things aren&rsquo;t great., It brings clarity and rest.</li>
<li>On Friday evening <a href="/2023/09/30/film-club-s01e01">I attend the first edition</a> of a new local film club I joined. It confirms what I already know: I love the horror genre, and I love discussing cinema with people who didn&rsquo;t finish film school Anja I&rsquo;m looking at you.</li>
<li>Ever since we <a href="/2023/08/17/norway-et-al">visited Hija de Sanchez in Copenhagen</a> Anja and I have gotten really into Mexican food. By now, I&rsquo;m so well-versed in the art of a simple-but-sublime taco, that I whip up a delicious meal. Who knew tacos required so little filling?</li>
<li>On Saturday, I visit Micropia, a zoo-adjacent museum about microbes. I expect to be queasy throughout the entire visit, terrified by the unfortunate-looking mini animals that live in and on every part of my body. Instead, I&rsquo;m amazed by the beauty of nature. During the mini class I ask a question about algae: if their bodies move towards light and they&rsquo;re under a microscope for a while, where light comes from all sides, what happens to their health? The laboratory assistant tells me the museum swaps petri dishes regularly so that the algea don&rsquo;t die. What happens before death, though, I wonder.</li>
<li>On Sunday, Chenelva comes over for afternoon drinks. She&rsquo;s one of those rare people: an instant connection and plenty of common ground to grow out friendship on. We marvel at how little we know about queer BIPOC Amsterdam.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve completed the first season of the Dutch reality show &ldquo;B&amp;B vol liefde&rdquo;, in which B&amp;B owners invite four dates into their home. Hate-watching reality television with Anja is one of my favorite pastimes.</li>

      <p>Yesterday, I attended the very first gathering of FC de Filmfanaten, a brand-new film club that my friend Jolien started. There were four of us, and we discussed the movie I was proud to have suggested: <em><a href="Talk%20To%20Me.md">Talk To Me</a></em>. I love speaking about films with others, and particularly with this diverse group of people. Everyone brought a completely unique perspective to the film, one brought film industry insights while the other had thoughtful ideas that I hadn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<p>Below are the notes I took (in Dutch).</p>

      <ul>
<li>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I&rsquo;ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I&rsquo;m writing this the sky is gray and it&rsquo;s raining, but this week&rsquo;s weather was cheerful and moderate.</li>
<li>On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I&rsquo;ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a <em>lot</em> from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.</li>
<li>I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn&rsquo;t be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I&rsquo;m fortunate to call her my friend.</li>
<li>I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">People &amp; Blogs</a></em> is off to a good start. To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people&rsquo;s websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.</li>
<li>Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to inviting them to our place.</li>
<li>On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja&rsquo;s bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like [[modular living|modular living]], and I&rsquo;m feeling less and less awkward about the way we&rsquo;re going about it in our house.</li>
<li>At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.</li>
<li>After visiting Anja&rsquo;s mom in the afternoon, we biked to Kriterion to Watch [[Oppenheimer (2023)|Oppenheimer (2023)]].</li>
<li>Much like the last few days, I&rsquo;m not in the best of states. There&rsquo;s an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I&rsquo;m slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m nearing the end of my journal, and I&rsquo;m surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20680004/notebook-journal-finish-strategies">like the rest of the world, as it appears</a>, I had trouble finishing a journal in a relaxed manner. Looking at the first entry, I see I have 29 days left until it&rsquo;ll have been one year exactly. Hello nerves.</li>

<li>IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can&rsquo;t keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn&rsquo;t have been more excited to welcome my <a href="https://vineandfig.co/">Vine &amp; Fig friends</a> Pickles and Patrick to the city. They&rsquo;re two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.</li>
<li>I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick&rsquo;s husband, couldn&rsquo;t make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.</li>
<li>I joined the V&amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we&rsquo;ve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.</li>
<li>Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.</li>
<li>I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to <a href="https://takeichi-ramen.eu/">Takeichi</a>, my favorite ramen place where I always order anything but ramen, and to <a href="https://studio-k.nu/">Studio K</a>, where they met Lemonade, who chewed through her leash in what seemed like a quiet moment.</li>
<li>On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at <a href="https://abrahamkef.nl/vestigingen/proeflokaal/">Abraham Kef in Noord</a>. It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say &ldquo;momma&rdquo;. I want to make my own cheese.</li>
<li>After dinner at <a href="https://thuskomme.nl/">Thuskomme</a> on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.</li>
<li>It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business. One minute we&rsquo;re talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.</li>
<li>On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I&rsquo;ve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it&rsquo;s becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.</li>
<li>On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop&rsquo;s garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.</li>

    <content>
      <p>I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn&rsquo;t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</p>
<p>Yesterday wasn&rsquo;t a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend&rsquo;s citizenship party and I&rsquo;d call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.</p>
<p>As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he&rsquo;s teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s when I begin to talk about tension-building&rdquo; he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows &ldquo;you know what moment I&rsquo;m talking about, right?&rdquo; I say yes but I don&rsquo;t. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.</p>
<p>He turns towards to his friends and continues. &ldquo;I lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I&rsquo;m so nervous, thinking &lsquo;gosh, did I really misread all the signs?!&rsquo;&rdquo; Apparently, then I said these words, which&hellip;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he&rsquo;s talking about me.</p>
<p>Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew <a href="Cat%20whisper.md">Cat whisper</a>s at each other.</p>
<p>My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we&rsquo;d ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.</p>
<p>Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who&rsquo;s on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops.  I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.</p>

      <ul>
<li>Met [[Tim Bleeker|Tim Bleeker]] at [[Somerlust Park|Somerlust Park]] on [[2023-08-22|Tuesday]], a get-together that started as &ldquo;chilling in the park&rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&rsquo; requests. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine the type of person that would do this, and then I looked around.</li>
<li>I still seem to have a pinguecula because of <a href="/2023/07/22/norway-et-al-2023/">the time I spent in an airconditioned car not too long ago</a>, although my eye is far less red than last week. I feel guilty for disgusting any reader with this information, but hey, they&rsquo;re weeknotes. Long story short, I now have sunglasses.</li>
<li>Watched <em>[[Hillsong, A megachurch exposed|Hillsong, A megachurch exposed]]</em>, and learned a lot about how the church has propelled itself into popularity. Knowing how anti-queer the church has always been, I never felt comfortable attending a service in Amsterdam. The early 10s fashion made me feel nostalgic, though.</li>
<li>Had a lovely workshop at work about effective team work. It was inspiring, educational, and great for a sense of collaboration, not just with my peers, but also with the company&rsquo;s leadership. It&rsquo;s wonderful to be a part of a company that walks its talk so enthusiastically.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m struggling to be a good dog mom to Lemonade, seeing Anja&rsquo;s conduct and training as much more effective and kind. I&rsquo;ve been working to praise her good behavior more than I punish her mistakes.</li>
<li>I was off on [[2023-08-25|Friday]], and I went to an early-morning showing of <em>[[Talk to Me (2023)|Talk to Me (2023)]]</em>, which I&rsquo;ll most likely do again. A cute retired Amsterdam couple were discussing their elaborate weekend cooking plans, which I found delighting. They proceeded to talk all throughout the movie.</li>
<li>I tidied [[Annelie Wambeek|Annelie Wambeek]]&rsquo;s house now that she&rsquo;s coming back from her month abroad. I brought her some eggs, bread, milk, some treats, and flowers, and I made sure to leave the house smelling fresh. I hope it makes her feel good when she comes home tonight.</li>
<li>I spent Saturday and Sunday <a href="/2023-08-27-12-43-45">tinkering on the website</a>, and feel good about the results.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for a good strategy for [[Bible study|Bible study]] in [[Obsidian|Obsidian]], and I managed to find a verse-per-file translation of the [[King James Bible|King James Bible]] on <a href="https://faithbasedproductivity.com/cross-reference-library-obsidian/">FaithBasedProductivity.com</a> that I added to my Obsidian vault. It took a couple of days before the whole thing was properly synced across my devices, which I suspect might be the result of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/112ynkj/background_sync_on_ios/">Obsidian Sync not be able to perform background syncs</a>. It made me consider switching to iCloud Sync for a second, but honestly I can&rsquo;t be bothered. I&rsquo;m keen to see when I&rsquo;ll actually begin using the 33,613 files that are taking up over 100 mb in my vault.</li>
<li>I found myself missing church this week. I&rsquo;m excited for [[All Saints Amsterdam|All Saints Amsterdam]] to start back up again mid-September. I&rsquo;m curious to see what&rsquo;s in store for us.</li>
<li>[[Mark Delany|Mark Delany]] came over for Lemonade cuddles and dinner on [[2023-08-26|Saturday]]. I made [[Tacos|Tacos]], successfully if I do say so myself, and we had a lovely time catching up and discussing what really matters: the fact that Mark uses the word &ldquo;taco&rdquo; as a standard synonym for female genitalia. I&rsquo;m still laughing.</li>

<li>The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I&rsquo;m just landing.</li>
<li>No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam <em>isn‚Äôt</em> using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be. On Sunday, I go for a long bike ride to Amsterdamse Bos and back, and crossing the Berlagebrug I&rsquo;m struck by how quiet the street is without cars racing by. I like it.</li>
<li>I finished watching <em>[[The Righteous Gemstones|The Righteous Gemstones]]</em>, and I miss them already.</li>
<li>Anja&rsquo;s still off for the summer, and I&rsquo;m watching her slowly recover from being my personal chauffeur for two weeks</li>
<li>The Summer makes me not want to cook. It&rsquo;s no help that I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://anneliewambeek.com/">Annelie</a>&rsquo;s apartment to work while she&rsquo;s travelling, and that I use the occasion to order poke bowls for lunch. I&rsquo;m surprised by the quality of <a href="https://pokeperfect.nl/en/amsterdam/linnaeusstraat/">Poke Perfect</a>&rsquo;s teriyaki chicken bowl, extra edamame.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m reading and enjoying Robin Meyer&rsquo;s <em>[[Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)|Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)]]</em>, a tool to make my interest in [[orthopraxy|orthopraxy]] more tangible.</li>

<p>After two weeks in Scandinavia, it&rsquo;s clear: we are both too Dutch for proper recycling. Secretly hoarding our trash to avoid a reprimanding from our AirBnb host as he hovers over his six-compartment recycling bin, we continue our trip from rural Sweden to Copenhagen looking for a public recycling station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine if we got so nervous about doing it wrong that we ended up just dumping these bags by the roadside&rdquo; I say to Anja.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Tuesday, two Dutch lesbians were found dead just outside of Lidk√∂ping after the Swedish environmental police task force shot them at point-blank range for abusing the recycling system. Their families have been notified, begrudgingly.&rdquo; Anja jokes, staring off into the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <em>Queen &amp; Slim</em>, but King &amp; Thicc!&rdquo;, I suggest, &ldquo;You can be King&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m thicc, too&rdquo;, Anja complains.</p>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;re home again, back from our first proper vacation in four years, and boy oh boy, did we need it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our plan was simple: make Anja&rsquo;s dream come true by renting a Tesla, drive it to Norway, do nothing there for a week, and then spend another week slowly making our way back via the Swedish countryside, and Copenhagen, where our friends live.</p>
<p>After two long, well-airconditioned days in our wonderful car we made it to Eastern Norway. In Hallingdal, one of the country&rsquo;s most popular ski destinations, we found a beautiful and cozy cabin on top of a mountain, overlooking the Tisleifjorden. To our surprise, it proved the perfect getaway for people who didn&rsquo;t really want to&hellip; <em>do</em> anything.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s indeed exquisite, the Norwegian faith in our human ability to treat nature with respect. Quietly, it makes an enormous difference. The difference is in the shared understanding of where we leave our trash. It&rsquo;s in the thousands of cabins spread out across the country, <a href="https://english.dnt.no/">where travellers can stay for next to nothing</a>. It&rsquo;s in the fire wood left behind in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/golsfjelletvest/posts/pfbid021q9V7g4XeKd5Wz3QfEbxmsBHWVYmEHEb9mqBT4mn1F34SUCe8LoafcfE6fE61pQBl?locale=nl_NL">freely-accessible <em>grillhytte</em></a>. It&rsquo;s in the canoe that just lays by the water, available to anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even really have to lock your doors&rdquo;, one fisherman commented while teaching his son to throw a line.</p>
<p>We never kept our doors unlocked, of course. The city is embedded in our system too deeply, as were the countless &ldquo;cabin in the woods&rdquo; movie plots I remembered. If anything, though, it helped us pause, listen to the sound of nothing, and listen to our bodies, which were telling us to take that second nap of the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, one day earlier than intended, we swiftly packed the car and drove all night to Lidk√∂ping, by V√§nern, Sweden&rsquo;s largest lake. While we&rsquo;d been napping and relaxing, the world was reading the headlines about Storm Hans, a twice-a-century type of storm that would&rsquo;ve gotten us stuck on that mountain if we hadn&rsquo;t left when we did. That three hours of driving through landslide-prone mountains wasn&rsquo;t going to be pleasant, even in a well-heated Tesla.</p>
<p>The clouds were low as we drove off.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Copenhagen, <em>kubnhawn</em> for the in-crowd, was a lot lighter, sunnier, and safer. We stayed with Naomi, Shlomik and little Goldie. Their cute, young family, the house, and the fact that were surrounded by thousands of people everywhere we went, was everything I needed after the quiet Norwegian fjords. One day exploring the city was enough to convince me: I need to visit again.</p>

    <content>
      <p>I am notorious for never grasping how many people know how much about what. To save myself from any further embarrassment I won&rsquo;t spend my time here telling you what the app is about. The team does that nicely over here. I do think I have something to say about what Scriptogr.am came exactly at the right time for me.</p>
<p>As we more further down the line of Web 2.0 and slowly into the abyss that is Web 3.0, I feel the definitions of web design are evolving greatly. I remember back in the day when it was just one website out of fifty that looked really beautiful, and how I would spend many hours on the site just being surrounded by all the pretty. Now, as more and more distinct design trends are emerging, looking pretty isn&rsquo;t the main goal anymore. It has become a criterium. And most websites I know meet that criterium in one way or another. Now that the eyes have what they need, the user wants for the website to be up to speed with their brain.</p>
<p>And this is where websites fail.</p>
<p>Not all websites have the potential of being minimalist, small and clean code-wise. Pardon me if I say that the designers might know ways to get there, but experience tells me clients always manage to come up with ways to make a code more extensive than it should be. So, some of the websites I am talking about can be exempt from my suggestion. But certainly, and most of all, I am talking about the weblog. A place where, once in 1992, a HTML page and new words every now and then would suffice. We have come a long way from that simple structure. Now, with everybody tuning into Wordpress, Drupal, and Tumblr for ready-made templates and every single widget known to man, I feel I&rsquo;m becoming more and more detached from simple, beautiful web design and UI.</p>
<p>Scriptogr.am, to me, is a great answer. It gives me very few options: I can write, display some links, even add an image if I like, but that is as far as I am gonna go. There are no custom archives, last.fm user grids, Flickr photo streams or twenty PHP pages I can configure any way I want to. It is me, my words, a few nice web fonts, a few links, and the ease of writing from anywhere in a cloud. Scriptogr.am allows me to ask myself a question I was afraid to ask myself for a long time: why does my website need every available function? Why do blogs take up so much space?</p>
<p>This website is now as much a personal space as it is a manifest and an experiment. In the upcoming weeks or months I will experience what it is like to use one app that is always with me and directly upload content to my website without having to do much beside write. I truly believe that, as a blogger (whether you are a professional or an absolute amateur like me), it is crucial to know how much effort writing a blog should take. In my opinion, it should take very little. Not only because it is simply too much work, but also because I&rsquo;ve learnt that keeping my blog beautiful and cool became more important than actually writing on it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes.</p>

      <p>A sunny afternoon in Gol, Norway. This one came out slightly on the light side, but it still works for me. Focus is fine. The lighting in the corners makes me wonder: is there some kind of vignette thing going on?</p>

      <p>Lemonade in her first ever dog bed in Gol, Norway. I don&rsquo;t know why this came out with improper focus. Was it my proximity to Lemonade, or the fact that the room was quite dark without the flash? Does the Polaroid focus at any moment? Can I adjust that focus?</p>

      <p>A sunny early morning in the Swedish countryside. We stayed at this lovely AirBnb on the way to Norway. It seems the tree outline is trapped in a weird soft focus. Other than that, I like this picture.</p>

      <p><a href="/2023/04/26/dear-nienke-you-should-have-a-website/">Nienke</a>, Mehdi, an anonymous friend, and I attend the annual Pride March. It&rsquo;s the city&rsquo;s first <a href="https://pride.amsterdam/en/pride-foundation/">two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam</a>, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term &ldquo;queer&rdquo;, I am pleased <a href="https://queer-amsterdam.org/">Queer Amsterdam</a> is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.</p>
<p>On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &ldquo;an anonymous friend&rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wear my face mask&rdquo; he says, 20 minutes into the event. &ldquo;Am I getting too close?&rdquo; I ask, concerned. No, he just doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable being photographed. The off chance that his parents may see him is not worth it.</p>
<p>As we walk, I think about the meaning of the word &ldquo;pride&rdquo;. If we walk in a Pride March, can we be proud without wanting to be photographed and broadcast for anyone to see? A sign in the crowd reads &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be what you can&rsquo;t see&rdquo;, and I agree. Representation is crucial, to this my life is a testament. But what burden does that place on people whose visibility is dangerous to themselves?</p>
<p>The intersection of queerdom, the way it interacts with ethnicity, religion, ability, neurodivergence, age, education, and location, is why I&rsquo;m here today. Why I&rsquo;m here at all. Mehdi, who has never attended a Pride event in his life, learns to shout along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do we want?<br>
TRANS RIGHTS!<br>
When do we want them?<br>
NOW!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speeches this year spark my interest. <a href="https://pride.amsterdam/ambassadors/tieneke-sumter/">Tieneke</a> talks about consent, an oft-overlooked point of concern in our queer communities. Someone whose name I forgot talks about bisexuality. I remember how unsettling it was as a young adult that people told me I was &ldquo;in transit&rdquo;, on my way to being either gay or straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here today shouting for myself, a little bit, but also to engage in the praxis of allyship which is by default an aspirational habit: doing the things we know to be right, without determining for other people whether we can call ourselves their allies.</p>

      <p>At the end of the shopping street<br>
for people who look like<br>
they do in the magazines<br>
there‚Äôs a blonde marching in place waiting<br>
for the light to turn green.<br>
She is not running per se, rather<br>
she‚Äôs hinting at running.<br>
Selling it, the way<br>
Charlize Theron sells<br>
a night to remember in a perfume commercial<br>
with next to nothing for evidence.</p>
<p>Me, a tired mother,<br>
and a tennis player with wet hair<br>
stare at the blonde,<br>
one more covertly than<br>
the others.<br>
I know not to tilt my head<br>
when encounting something<br>
in which the world tells me<br>
I will never see myself.</p>
<p>There are so many things<br>
that are perfect<br>
about the blonde that I<br>
get dizzy counting.<br>
Even a thigh gap as big as hers<br>
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold<br>
all the details.</p>
<p>At this point, the length,<br>
and the waviness, and the glossiness,<br>
and the readiness of her hair<br>
are just a complete unnecessity.</p>
<p>We all hate her, the blonde.<br>
Me, a tired mother,<br>
and a tennis player with wet hair.<br>
We hate her because<br>
of all the little things<br>
the world has denied us<br>
the words to articulate.</p>
<p>We all hate her, the blonde,<br>
and the blonde hates herself<br>
a little, too,<br>
for reasons so bafflingly<br>
unimportant to us<br>
she could die from jealousy.</p>

      <ul>
<li>This week, I attended my first Gerimedica party. It‚Äôs great to know I can expect a big celebration every year, and not just for the company‚Äôs sweet sixteen. It confirmed what I already know: great vibe, great taste, great people.</li>
<li>I went to Bar Bario on Saturday for a meet-up called Hair Haven, which fosters connection between people with curly hair. Again, I was struck by how welcoming the space is. It‚Äôs a ridiculous feeling, being the norm there.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired these days. Too much fun, too little rest. I‚Äôm better at napping, though. On Sunday, I barely wanted to get out of bed after a little snooze. Three years ago, a nap was unthinkable.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm giving Reni Eddo-Lodge‚Äòs <em>Why I‚Äôm No Longer Talking to White People About Race</em> another spin. The title alone makes it a hard read, but I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll find myself along the way.</li>
<li>I saw <em>Dalva</em> at Ketelhuis. Reading the reviews, I‚Äôm surprised so many people seem to interpret the girl‚Äôs dress style as ‚Äúan adult woman in the 50s‚Äù. I thought it was reminiscent of the way girls dressed when the camera first came out. Not a girl, not yet a woman. Regardless, I imagine being Dalva‚Äôs mother, getting to know her daughter again, and understanding what has gone so wrong in the fibers of het child. It sends chills down my spine.</li>
<li>In another childhood trauma narrative, I thought it was so moving that Jan Broberg played the therapist in the Showtime series on her turbulent childhood. I fantasized the scenes functioned as a systemic family constellation, her talking to her childhood self. The reality was probably much more technical than that.</li>
<li>Anja had a very intense and short stint with <em>Call of Duty</em>, remarking on its evocative storytelling in the Cold War portion. She finished it, though, and the zombies turned om her off with such immediacy that she‚Äôs back to NBA.</li>
<li>After hearing it only once, Billie Eilish‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 30th‚Äù is stuck in my head. She and her brother have a good thing going.</li>

      <p>Two months of onboarding have rushed by in a blink. The new job is absolutely wonderful: the people are great, the work is complex and important, and the office itself is perhaps the finest I&rsquo;ve ever worked at. I joined this company because the challenges they have seemed interesting to me. I&rsquo;m very pleased that, two months in, it&rsquo;s difficult to think that, at one point in time, these challenges weren&rsquo;t also mine. I&rsquo;ve made the right decision.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I met two friends with whom I share a special history. The time we spent together resulted in many things. One of them was the tattoo on my left arm that say &ldquo;WAT ER IS&rdquo; (&ldquo;what is there&rdquo;). Spending my evening with them, sharing a meal, shedding a few tears, reminded me of why the tattoo is there.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Anja and I watched Keti Koti&rsquo;s <a href="https://ketikotiamsterdam.nl/bigi-spikri-optocht/">Bigi Spikri memorial service</a> on television. I truly detest that the thing we requested became such a point of contention, that finally getting it almost made us forget that what we requested was a minimum viable product. Still, King Willem Alexander offering an apology and asking for forgiveness was history in the making. As an Afropean person I&rsquo;m easily erased from the Dutch narrative of Trans-Atlantic slave trade that focuses on the Netherlands and her former colonies. Mentioning us by name specifically let Willem Alexander articulate how well he has been listening these past few years.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we made our way to Museumplein for the Keti Koti festival. Upside: I got to eat cotton candy, twice, and we got to financially contribute to many great Black causes in the city. Downside: I spent way too much time in line for food with hundreds of other people.</p>
<p>Reading! I finished a book. I have a track record of struggling to enjoy reading as a burnt-out lit major, but [[Citizen (2015)|Citizen (2015)]] was easy to get through. It turns out I am enthusiast of the lyric essay genre. I picked up a book of poetry by Anton de Kom at Keti Koti, and I&rsquo;m diving head-first into that.</p>

      <p>I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. I check the news multiple times a day. I scoff at outlets that don&rsquo;t deem it worthy of the front page. I also scoff at outlets that do. A media drama can antagonize me the way Adele disappoints me with her popularity.</p>
<p>The fact that I‚Äôm part of a Titanic/<em>Titanic</em>-obsessed gaggle of netizens somehow has me convinced I&rsquo;m not just procrastinating. Five men with money ‚Äî sums of it ‚Äî on their way to Titanic in a little titanium box, are lost at sea. To empathize, the world holds her breath.</p>
<p>Growing up without my father, I never gave much thought to the reality in which he once found himself, well over half a century ago. Ten years old, him and his football team of siblings, on a boat, lost at sea. I wonder if the five men ever saw Titanic. I wonder if they cried.</p>
<p>I imagine he was lost at sea the way only a child can be: cursed with the spirit of adventure. Where did the boat depart from? Did he bring a toy? Was there a tiger? The only way I can read the scene is with the poetry of someone who‚Äôll never know what it‚Äôs like to leave home when home is the mouth of a shark.</p>
<p>The Internet continues her wailing. Debris is found. The 19-year-old had only tagged along to make Father‚Äôs Day one to remember. I don‚Äôt know the story about my father‚Äôs father. I never celebrated a proper Father‚Äôs Day. My father‚Äôs father was long dead before the boat was put out to sea. Yes?</p>
<p>A Dutch news site tells me, at the bottom in small font, about their podcast episode. Who is responsible for the boat refugees who drowned off the Greek coast? Could we leave their bodies on the ocean floor? On Reddit, people share animated maps of the football team of rescue boats circling Titanic.</p>
<p>I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. Like a mosquito it drowns out the other humming. Like a natural disaster it refrigerates the other stories, the puzzles I fear I will never solve.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Every time I embark on a journey towards a published post about why it&rsquo;s good to have a website, I get lost in the reality of personal details. Everyone has different reasons for believing something. Aiming to take them all into account doesn&rsquo;t help me write anything that feels worthwhile and not like a derivative<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It feels much more relevant to focus my attention on specific people. In this case I&rsquo;m focusing my attention on you, Nienke. I think you should have a personal website. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>You should have a personal website not because you need to grow an audience, and turn your hobbyist writing into a profession.</p>
<p>You should have a personal website not because you&rsquo;re an expert on some subject, and it would be cruel to deny the world your wisdom.</p>
<p>You should have a personal website not because you think you&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p>You should have a personal website not because the world is in need of your highlight reel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should have a personal website because I think the online world is as real as the offline world. You have a presence in one, and you should have a presence in the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider your personal website an online living room of sorts. The place that displays, in a variety of ways, who you are, what you care about, and how you&rsquo;re moving through the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to invite anyone to come in, and have them see anything you deem relevant. They can stay for three seconds and walk out the door, or dwell for a bit, opening drawers, going back in time, answering questions, questioning answers.</p>
<p>Imagine that there are people on the other side of the world who would want to know how you&rsquo;re doing, what you&rsquo;re thinking and learning. Not because you&rsquo;re you, per se, but simply because you have in common the habit of sharing your experiences in an online space where you are the boss.</p>
<p>There is a <em>cozy web</em> out there, where people connect simply because they enjoy snacking on each other&rsquo;s slices of life: the seemingly unimportant moments, words, images that approximate what it means to be human.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine, also, what it means when I say &ldquo;you are the boss&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of how little you control about yourself on the Internet. The <code>.nl</code> website of your name is already registered, but are you its owner? I doubt it. Your company has a portrait of you on their website, and it&rsquo;s beautiful, but you can&rsquo;t add anything to the page it&rsquo;s on, can you?</p>
<p>You have an updated LinkedIn page and it&rsquo;s a great way for people to find you, but do you live to work or work to live? Besides, it&rsquo;s LinkedIn designers who decide for you what your profile will look like. If you&rsquo;d ever want to do anything other than write a post or update your experiences, you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old newsletter containing an interview with you, again with that wonderful portrait. It&rsquo;s probably because of your work that this is all I can find on you. It makes me sad, Nienke, it does.</p>
<p>You know why? I love learning about what you&rsquo;re up to. And I suspect the places where you share that are social media profiles that don&rsquo;t necessarily use your full name. It&rsquo;s great for privacy, of course, I get it. But I don&rsquo;t want to be on social media to stay in your loop.</p>
<p>Or rather, I want social media to be our websites. You read mine and I read yours, we write comments on our own websites and they&rsquo;re posted to each other&rsquo;s websites automatically.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Twitter can fall, Instagram can crumble, LinkedIn can add an expensive subscription model, but you and I will still have our websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to take up space on the Internet, Nienke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want you to enjoy doing so and perhaps even making new connections in the process. I want you to learn how to build your own website and tell me in a year that it&rsquo;s actually much easier than you thought. I want you to feel empowered. And to have a <a href="/now">now</a> page, and to keep lists on your websites of things you love in Amsterdam and beyond.</p>
<p>I want you to feel that you can escape the rat race of likes, favs, and reposts. I think what you have to say is worth more than the hipness of some platform.</p>
<p>I want you to fall in love with personal websites so much that you write about it on your website, and tell people about it at Coffee Company.</p>
<p>I want to share with you the wonderful community of random people from all over the world, who are so much more curious and enthusiastic, so genuinely supportive, and so much kinder than any of the communities I&rsquo;ve ever found on Big Tech platforms.</p>
<p>I want to read what you have to say about the world when you stop worrying what your blog should be called.</p>

    <content>
      <p>It&rsquo;s late in the morning and I&rsquo;m on my way to Gerimedica, the company&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. I&rsquo;m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.</p>
<p>The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building I&rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of calling my office. I cross the river Amstel, enjoy the sun, and marvel at the preparations people have been making.</p>
<p>In two days, King&rsquo;s Day is upon us. It&rsquo;s always a big event in the country, and specifically in Amsterdam, and this year it&rsquo;s extra special: our king was coronated ten years ago this year. In our house it&rsquo;s not a big deal, in fact Anja couldn&rsquo;t be more of an anti-monarchist if she tried. Lemonade&rsquo;s too young to pay it any mind, I&rsquo;m sure. But the rest of the country is getting ready.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s Day is full of traditions: young children playing the violin out of tune at the park, tompouce pastries, the king and his family on a heavily-televised trip to a Dutch city that has been preparing for this moment for a year. And forever and for always: people securing a spot on the flea market route days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Today, as I biked across the city, I saw hundreds of them; 40 square feet of pavement taped off by people aiming to use that specific spot to spend their King&rsquo;s Day. Peddling by, I thought to myself that it was a rather sweet unwritten rule: I put my name here in a manner that you could erase at any moment, but Dutch custom says you&rsquo;re to honor my plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to people marking these spots &ldquo;bezet&rdquo; (&ldquo;taken&rdquo;) or adding their name for emphasis. Today, however, I noticed many people had made a small figure with their tape, a maker&rsquo;s mark of sorts. I&rsquo;m learning through Anja&rsquo;s ceramics adventure that this is entirely common in the potter community: a small, minimalist figure telling the world you made something.</p>
<p>I hope all those people get what they came for: that specific spot on the pavement, and a fun day to help them Konmari their house. In the meantime, I also hope that the Amsterdamse Bos is quiet on King&rsquo;s Day. I&rsquo;m looking to take Anja and Lemonade there for a quiet afternoon, far away from the crowds.</p>

<p>Spring is here, I think? I spend the afternoon in the park with ex-colleague-turned-friend Susan, who is celebrating landing a new and challenging job. There&rsquo;s a boy in the park who&rsquo;s walking around barefoot. Later we see him on a slack line. I like this scene; it tells me that summer is almost upon us.</p>
<p>I never seem skilled at enjoying whatever season is here. Instead I&rsquo;m forever yearning for what&rsquo;s just out of reach. On Javastraat I pass a travel agency, the target audience of which most certainly is concerned with visiting Morocco or Turkey during the summer months. Surprisingly, there&rsquo;s a wide array of names that would inspire city trips around the world.</p>
<p>Ever since I passed the agency, Andrew Bird&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oecHq2neweA">Pulaski at Night</a> has been in my head non-stop. &ldquo;Come back to Chigaco, city of, city of light.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Today, Lemonade and I visited <a href="https://www.studiopansa.com/studio-pansa-amstel">Studio Pansa Amstel</a>, where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It&rsquo;s quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that&rsquo;s so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is &ldquo;dirty hands, clear mind&rdquo;, and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.</p>
<p>I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker&rsquo;s mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands. I think I&rsquo;ll sign up for one of Pansa&rsquo;s courses myself some day.</p>

<p>What I love most about today&rsquo;s snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade&rsquo;s eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to welcome Yana into our home for the first time. When I hired her in the late Winter of 2022 as our newest UX designer, I knew there was something special about her. Now, well over a year later, I&rsquo;m pleased to call her a friend. We caught up on career adventures, new trends in the design industry, and of course the joys of being a dog mom.</p>
<p>After Yana and DJ left, Anja and I began winding down for the day. After dinner, we watched the latest episode of the final season of <em>Succession</em>, which may have been my favorite one yet. The characters on this show are so complex and candidly-written. I&rsquo;m already low-key heartbroken that this show is going to end. At the same time, I&rsquo;m also pleased to be alive to watch it unfold in real time.</p>

      <p>Life sure is different now that we&rsquo;ve gotten Lemonade on a proper walking schedule. She still feels most comfortable going potty on the puppy pads we have on our balcony, but she absolutely loves going out and exploring the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised by how well she walks on a loose leash, and how few issues we&rsquo;ve had with the stuff she puts in her mouth. I&rsquo;m hoping to make most use of her imprint period, and that means familiarizing her with as many different things as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to find a cat on our morning walk. Lemonade responds to the cat the way I expected a dog would: oozing deference. They stand across from each other for a few minutes, and I reward Lemonade with cheese treats afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first step on the road to Lemonade meeting Pookie, my mother-in-law&rsquo;s cat.</p>

<p>When I first set foot in the <a href="https://amsterdam.oudkatholiek.nl/">Old Catholic Church</a> to attend an All Saints service, <a href="/2023/02/12/all-saints-amsterdam/">I knew I had found a special place</a>. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.</p>
<p>It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and it&rsquo;s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times. I see All Saints regulars as well as new people, shy and seemingly hopeful.</p>
<p>One woman in particular stands out to me because she smiles intently at me a few times. She has the demeanor of that good Christian girl from that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hqskev/scotts_tots_may_be_super_cringe_but_its_nearly/"><em>Office US</em> episode &ldquo;Christening&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>After service she finds me immediately: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Zinzy from <a href="https://meetup.com/queersalon">Queer Salon</a>, right?&rdquo; Annika says. Pre-pandemic memories begin to surface, and once she mentions her son I remember her again. &ldquo;The first time I came here, I thought of you&rdquo;, she says. We shmooze over crackers and sweet bread, exchange numbers to set a coffee date.</p>
<p>This new church is really a pilot by two reverends hoping to bring fully inclusive Christianity to the Amsterdam expat community. This is service eight out of ten. When I say that out loud, Reverend Howie casually says &ldquo;yes, we&rsquo;ll have to talk about that next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I already can&rsquo;t imagine myself without this community.</p>

      <p>Much like last year, I&rsquo;m so excited for Mathilde to visit our house that I get a headache just thinking about it. We&rsquo;ve known each other 23 years, and, by miracle, our friendship is both acclimatized to our adult lives <em>and</em> as full of energy and curiosity as it was when we met in our first year of secondary school.</p>
<p>She comes bearing gifts: seeds for the garden, dyke poetry, David Sedaris. She knows what I like. We eat, this time around I&rsquo;ve kept it simple with dishes from the traiteur and not ten separate homemade recipes of intricate delicacies. We talk about what teaching means to her and Anja. We play with Lemonade.</p>
<p>As a friend, Mathilde is very easy to love. Our times together eventually always bring us back to our shared emotional outlet: making music. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nervous to sing around you, Zinzy&rdquo; she says, but her voice sounds beautiful, warm, and exactly what my piano calls for. When I think of &ldquo;blue-eyed soul&rdquo; I think of Mathilde&rsquo;s voice. We tell each other Anja and I will make it down south this year, and we&rsquo;ll go for c√¥te de b≈ìuf in Maastricht. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>I met Shervin at the coffee place this morning. We know each other very casually; we used to frequent the same co-working space, we&rsquo;re LinkedIn friends. He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.</p>
<p>We exchange how life is treating us, what we&rsquo;re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what you&rsquo;ll be doing. He lets me in on secrets around the next meetup, and tells me what kind of activities are involved. It sounds magical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s beauty in the not knowing, we agree. In the whimsy of the unexpected, the sudden connection we may feel with other humans. I tell him his project reminds me of Marina Abramoviƒá, whom Anja and I were fortunate enough to meditate with <a href="https://carre.nl/pagina/marina-in-carre">in Carre last year</a>. Participating in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/nyregion/04about.html">her famous eye-gazing practice</a> with complete strangers was transformative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I got an invitation.</p>

      <ul>
<li>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: <a href="patrickrhone.com">Patrick Rhone</a> and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/13189-2/">to catch the planning stage on his blog</a> right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at <a href="http://www.cafedetuin.nl/">Cafe de Tuin</a>, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing &ldquo;raise a glass to freedom&rdquo;. Fine people, they are.</li>
<li>After another week with Lemonade, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel more confident about raising her to be a well-behaved, confident puppy. For the most part, she&rsquo;s doing very well. The only real challenge we have is the barking to which she&rsquo;ll resort every time she&rsquo;s in the crate but not sleeping. Through trial and error, we&rsquo;re slowly learning how to help her settle down more easily, and this week, the efforts have begun to pay off.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got some exciting news forthcoming that isn&rsquo;t quite ready for the public just yet, but it has managed to lift my spirits greatly. I&rsquo;ll be able to write more in the next few weeks, but for now it&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m feeling hopeful, inspired, and ready.</li>
<li>While Anja had apparently been around to watch season one when it was released, I&rsquo;ve only now turned onto the wonderful journey that is <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. I would never actually ask the universe for a reboot of <em>The Office: US</em>, but this new mockumentary revolving around a poorly-managed, underfunded Philadelphia public school has exactly the vibe I would&rsquo;ve hoped to get from that nonexistent reboot. It&rsquo;s just nice that, with this show, Black people are at the front and center.</li>
<li>Spring has officially begun, but as one of the regulars at my coffee place said: &ldquo;the question isn&rsquo;t when spring begins but when  rain ends&rdquo;. It seems the weather&rsquo;s getting better, though, and I can feel I&rsquo;m on the cusp of storing away my winter coat. It has been a long time coming.</li>

      <p>Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven&rsquo;t spoken in eight years.</p>
<p>I had emailed him late last year, missing our kitchen table conversations over coffee and cigarettes. His enormous house, a former school, functioning as his private art studio / gallery. He had replied right away, saying &ldquo;my phone number is still the same&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I had lost it long ago, of course.</p>
<p>Today, as I walk home from a coffee run, I think of him, and decide that I should make one last attempt to find his phone number before emailing him again. Looking over his message, I notice he said he no longer lived in the old school, and something about nuns. I suppose I had overlooked it the first time I read it, imagining he lived <em>near</em> a convent rather than in an actual carmelite care facility.</p>
<p>A friendly nun is happy to give me his number right away. A glimpse into a world of old, filled with kind people making generous assumptions. Two minutes later I hear his voice. &ldquo;hello?&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all surprised you ended up living with a bunch of nuns, Paul&rdquo; I glee into the phone, remembering our conversations about the Church, his Protestant, mine Catholic. There had always been something about Catholic liturgy that inspired him.</p>
<p>Despite his heavy bout of Covid, double pneumonia, and delirium, he still remembers me. Within minutes, we slide back into a conversation that never really began and never really ended.</p>
<p>Both of us are still the same to one another.</p>
<p>He gives me splinters of stories: a thieving cleaning lady, the storage and eventual donation of his body of work, the conversations he has with his neighbor priest. I tell him about Anja, about our small apartment, and about my eternal journey finding a Christian place I can call home.</p>
<p>We agree that I&rsquo;ll come visit soon, and I will. A few misremembered numbers and names aside, he&rsquo;s still the same old Paul. But by God, he nearly wasn&rsquo;t here, and I don&rsquo;t have time to waste.</p>

      <ul>
<li>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year.</li>
<li>After two weeks of cocooning, we&rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see she&rsquo;s such a relaxed and curious dog.</li>
<li>This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I don&rsquo;t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and I&rsquo;m grateful I was able to take this time off.</li>
<li>I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; to &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, don&rsquo;t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like I&rsquo;m not a proper Christian. Regardless, it&rsquo;s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.</li>
<li>Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didn&rsquo;t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Here&rsquo;s to hoping they&rsquo;ll become best friends.</li>
<li><a href="https://anneliewambeek.com">Annelie</a> came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. She&rsquo;s Lemonade&rsquo;s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.</li>
<li>Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. She&rsquo;s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. I&rsquo;m proud of her.</li>

      <p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loul√©. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-roi-of-good-research">The ROI of good research</h3>
<p>Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs">McCann Dogs</a>, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.</p>
<p>Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn&rsquo;t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it&rsquo;s great to see how quickly she&rsquo;s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann&rsquo;s course <a href="https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials">Puppy Essentials</a>, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.</p>
<h3 id="i-got-cabin-fever">I got cabin fever</h3>
<p>Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we&rsquo;ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.</p>
<p>Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn&rsquo;t actually let her <em>walk</em> just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It&rsquo;s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.</p>
<h3 id="the-beauty-of-trust">The beauty of trust</h3>
<p>Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they&rsquo;ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it&rsquo;s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she&rsquo;s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.</p>

      <p>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it&rsquo;s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>
<p>You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu&rsquo;s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can&rsquo;t help but fangirl. I&rsquo;m here because she&rsquo;s a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day.</p>
<p>Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in <a href="https://allsaintsamsterdam.com/">All Saints Amsterdam</a>?</p>

<p>Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20. Sometimes I wait outside for a few minutes until their doors open at 08:30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medium decaf mocaccino, half cow&rsquo;s milk, half Tony Chocolonely.&rdquo; I say it, but none of the baristas need reminding. Sometimes I bring my computer to work on my personal site, sometimes I bring a book and my diary. I&rsquo;m not the only one who lives Saturday mornings like this.</p>
<p>This morning I hung out, drawing people who were conducting a similar Saturday morning routine. A great start to the weekend.</p>

      <p>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We&rsquo;ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so &ldquo;dress for cold, hope for warmth&rdquo; I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so proud of the work Annelie has been doing, <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">building a business from scratch</a>, and wrapping her head around how she can do her best work. We discuss productivity; tools, methods, apps, Etsy calendar print-outs. Today, I tell her how much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips">Elizabeth Filips</a> has been helping me. We decide we should join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/shutupandwriteamsterdam/">Shut Up &amp; Write</a> sometime.</p>
<p>It was clear from the start to both Anja and I that Annelie would make a great godmother for <a href="http://lemonade.waleson.us/">Lemonade the puppy</a>. We&rsquo;ve decided to go full over-the-top with anything dog-related, and luckily Annelie is more than happy to review my birth announcement card options. She couldn&rsquo;t radiate more enthusiasm about this dog if she tried. And she hasn&rsquo;t even met her yet.</p>
<p>As we shmoozed over coffee, I was reminded of the time when doing this indoors wasn&rsquo;t even possible. I remember the Coffee Company line going all the way around the block, the overflowing trash bins with paper coffee cups, the increasing amount of fresh air we were all taking in. It&rsquo;s nice to spend time indoors again, but I do miss the park. I can&rsquo;t wait for spring to start.</p>

      <p>January flew, <em>flew</em> by, I tell you. We started with &ldquo;wow, 2023 already, let&rsquo;s have a chill time this year, hey what&rsquo;s on Netflix?&rdquo; and at the time of writing everything is different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things are not chill, because we&rsquo;re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy</li>
<li>Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy</li>
<li>We cancelled Netflix</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying for years that I&rsquo;d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform. I suppose it&rsquo;s never going to happen, but, hey, at least we&rsquo;ll have that puppy, right?</p>
<h3 id="the-puppy">The puppy!</h3>
<p>Like I said, we kicked off the year very quietly, thinking &ldquo;meh, someone asked us if we wanted a puppy, but we&rsquo;re not really sure just yet.&rdquo; This all changed ones we learned that eight healthy puppies were born and we were allowed to pick first. <a href="/2023/01/15/sneak-preview/">We went for a visit</a> mid-January, and fell deeply in love with little Lemonade, who&rsquo;s coming home at the end of February.</p>
<p>I went from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/">serious dog-free advocate</a> to an expecting dog parent in two months&rsquo; time, and I suppose it&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;ve gone a bit mad. I&rsquo;m designing a birth announcement card, and <a href="https://lemonade.waleson.us/">the puppy may or may not already have a website</a>. Help me.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I picked up a few great titles at the <a href="https://www.oba.nl/openingstijden/detail.199270.html/oba-oosterdok/">library</a> this month. One that was helpful to get through was, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15733923"><em>Loose Cannons Back on Track</em></a>, about managing gifted neurodivergence in the workplace. At the moment, I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/321863.One_Continuous_Mistake"><em>One Continuous Mistake: Four Noble Truths for Writers</em></a> by Gail Sher.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Musically, the year is off to a great start. I&rsquo;ve made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INeMspNSQ0">a new Brian Eno discovery</a> that&rsquo;s hard not to love, found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMJm_97QXHA">Mitski gem</a> that has been on repeat, and added a great track to my work playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qsU8FGU_E">Tieduprightnow by Parcels</a>. As always, I&rsquo;ve compiled a playlist of all of these and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Xlr2LlyTQuCdgWd46KNUI?si=980c41a80e134089">Feel free to check it out</a>.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/"><em>Triangle of Sadness</em></a> again this month, and loved it more than I did the first time. I appreciate how well this movie understands the finality of our social roles, and how, at the same time, they can be transformed in the blink of an eye. In addition, I am secretly a 13-year-old boy who likes to look at people drowning in their own vomit and excrement.</p>
<p>Anja and I also began watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/"><em>Shrinking</em></a>, which is surprisingly fun. &lsquo;Men&rsquo;s liberation movement&rsquo; like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but ever so slightly more depressing and realistic.</p>
<h3 id="something-else">Something else</h3>
<p>I find myself looking for great influencers focused on gifted neurodivergence. Like those many awesome YouTubers sharing tips and tricks on how to live with ADHD, but for giftedness, and not in some Mensa kind of way, but just something that&rsquo;s honest about the challenges one may encounter. Most of what I find is written by pedagogues for parents of gifted children. If you know of anything, feel free to <a href="/hello">let me know</a>.</p>

      <p>There&rsquo;s a woman who runs a <a href="https://www.athenaeum.nl/winkels/zuidoost">bookshop in De Bijlmer</a>. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I&rsquo;m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She&rsquo;s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.</p>
<p>Aside from bookshop owner she&rsquo;s also a writer. I love the work she does at <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/">One World</a>, where she articulates <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/witte-fragiliteit-bestaat-niet/">strong perspectives</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/discriminatie/sociaal-onrecht/woke-ooit-een-waarschuwing-voor-racisme-nu-een-conservatief-hondenfluitje/">on antiracism</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/kamala-harris-is-niet-de-eerste-geschikte-zwarte-vrouw/">and equity</a>. A few weeks ago, she sold me this book:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I took it from the shelf, I didn&rsquo;t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they&rsquo;re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.</p>

<p>One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don&rsquo;t I see myself on television?</p>
<p>I imagine the life of Cole&rsquo;s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.</p>

      <p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can‚Äôt be satisfied.</p>
<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?‚Äù Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny‚Äôs owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>
<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she‚Äôd had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

      <p>We had two friends over today. They‚Äôre dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we‚Äôd one day get together and watch <em>Love Actually</em>, much-beloved by each of us.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.</p>
<p>Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me I‚Äôm not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if there‚Äôs any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?</p>

      <p>On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don‚Äôt know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm learning it‚Äôs not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan. I only recently became aware how much of a jerk that makes me, and how, if we were in a room full of people, I‚Äôd stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve wondered if I could be classified as a super-recognizer. I remember taking the test a few years ago and stopping halfway through, fearing that I‚Äôd see the faces of the people in my dreams and nightmares for all of eternity.</p>

    <content>
      <p>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>
<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang&rsquo;s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>
<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn&rsquo;t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I&rsquo;m from the South. I like it that way.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve always been afraid to sound was &ldquo;black&rdquo;. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I&rsquo;m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;good&rdquo;. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it&rsquo;s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I&rsquo;m just struck by the number of times I asked &ldquo;babe, is this the example we want to give?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself &ldquo;argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!&rdquo; Today is one of those days. I&rsquo;m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed by the rediscovery of life&rsquo;s unsteadiness. At the same time, there&rsquo;s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I&rsquo;ve been so anxious that bad news wasn&rsquo;t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>
<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it&rsquo;s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>

      <p>In a few days, I&rsquo;ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>
<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there&rsquo;s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I&rsquo;m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>
<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I&rsquo;ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>
<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life&rsquo;s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

    <content>
      <p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code>alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I&rsquo;ve come to regard <code>alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>
<p>For me, <code>alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don&rsquo;t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s slowest tooltip&rdquo;. In addition, I&rsquo;ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code>alt</code> text into places where it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Places that don&rsquo;t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>&rsquo;s profile and banner images.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of &ldquo;young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer&rdquo;. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>
<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness ‚Äî her self-awareness about what the image could convey ‚Äî that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>
<p>What does it mean, I&rsquo;ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code>alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we&rsquo;ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I&rsquo;d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>
<p>Today, Piper Haywood&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/">put me onto a handy <code>alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I&rsquo;m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, &ldquo;Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?&rdquo;, is &ldquo;use an empty <code>alt</code>&rdquo; and not &ldquo;don&rsquo;t post the image&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>

      <p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we&rsquo;ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We&rsquo;re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I&rsquo;m crying.</p>
<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn&rsquo;t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, I&rsquo;ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world&rsquo;s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about intuition and consistency.</p>

      <p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky&rsquo;s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don&rsquo;t: judge the film before I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>As a fat person, I&rsquo;m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I&rsquo;ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>
<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser&rsquo;s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they&rsquo;re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

      <p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I&rsquo;d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you&rsquo;ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; and your heart goes &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>

      <ul>
<li>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate!</li>
<li>Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said &ldquo;where are the tea lights?&rdquo;, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don&rsquo;t mind that we didn&rsquo;t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</li>
<li>This week was all about the new piano I bought. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking or talking about it.</li>
<li>All I&rsquo;ll say is: this piano project is the first one I&rsquo;m approaching through a neurodiverse lens, and it&rsquo;s making everything <em>so</em> much smoother and funner.</li>
<li>Illegally, I&rsquo;m mentioning something that happened in week 50. A. took me for my annual Fancy Birthday Dinner. For the first time since we began dating, I told her to leave it a surprise. I suppose it&rsquo;s one of those benefits of having gone to in-patient eating disorder treatment: chill vibes about food surprises. If you ever have an appetite for exquisite 10-course Asian fusion dining, book a table at <a href="https://101gowrie.com/">101 Gowrie</a>, where the atmosphere is as beautiful as the tableware, the bread is to cry over, and the umami is so intense that you&rsquo;ll have trouble putting it into words.</li>
<li>We needed a two-nighter to finish watching <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. I&rsquo;m very much at that point in my mid-thirties where finishing a feature film under a warm blanket on the sofa after 8 p.m. is a challenge. I love whodunits ‚Äî the genre might be in my top three ‚Äî but I was quite disappointed to learn that both A. and I were able to guess the ending within the first five minutes. Janelle Mon√°e and Kathryn Hahn looked great nonetheless.</li>
<li>All week, people kept asking me what I&rsquo;d be doing for Christmas, and I&rsquo;d cheerfully reply &ldquo;Nothing! You?&rdquo; every time. I feel liberated from the pressure to spend time with family or friends during the holidays, to eat more than I can carry, and to <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> fun. We certainly did have fun, just in a &ldquo;really couldn&rsquo;t be bothered&rdquo; kind of way.</li>
<li>I made my first batch of heavenly mud, a rich, creamy chocolate dessert. It was heavenly.</li>

      <ul>
<li>I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long. I mimic my late stepfather, who used to wimper like a puppy whenever he got a cold.</li>
<li>I still do well to limit my hours of screen time. Before I know it, I&rsquo;m stuck with a headache and dizzy spell.</li>
<li>Spotify&rsquo;s Discover Weekly was on point this week. Aside from lovely &ldquo;beards and log cabin&rdquo; tunes, as I call 70s soft rock, I&rsquo;ve fallen hard for the hyper pop track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4n0sVfRnd0UJsqcbPj7GqN?si=Z5yeyS2xTjOEWlOSI5EnmQ">&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;</a> by Moe Shop and Toriena.</li>
<li>We raced through another season of <em>The Crown</em>, this time with the excellent Elizabeth Debicki as Diana. I love how she manages to capture Diana so well despite <em>and</em> because of her camp-adjacent interpretation of her. I wonder if she ever got a sore neck during taping.</li>
<li>After protesting for weeks, I&rsquo;ve finally let Anja turn on the heating. So far, I haven&rsquo;t had much up-close experience with the energy crisis the world is currently facing, and I don&rsquo;t want that to change. It&rsquo;s great to feel my toes, though.</li>

    <content>
      <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally don&rsquo;t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel it&rsquo;s relevant to document what I&rsquo;ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: as is often the case for me, this site is built using my favorite flat-file content management system</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>: hosts the code for this website</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>: serves the content to my website</li>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>: I write in a single Obsidian vault</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git">obsidian-git</a>: helps me manage  the version control of my Obsidian content</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-git-subdirectory-as-branch">Push git subdirectory as branch</a>: a Github action that lets me publish a part of the content of my Obsidian vault to a separate repository</li>
<li><a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/netlify-updating-private-git-submodule/">Git submodule</a>: my separate repository is pulled into my website&rsquo;s code base</li>
<li><a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/how-to-trigger-daily-netlify-builds-using-github-actions/">Netlify build hook</a>: every day, Netlify looks for new content and publishes it to my website</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-is-great">Why this is great</h3>
<ul>
<li>I hold the strong belief that tools don&rsquo;t matter. This means, among other things, that I don&rsquo;t like to be limited to using particular platforms or apps to write. I want to see my files in a folder that I can move around. Jekyll allows me to do just this.</li>
<li>My website is a text-heavy space: most of what you&rsquo;ll find on here is written content. As a knowledge worker, writing is an integral part of my daily life. Many of the things I write are not for public consumption, but they are closely linked to things that <em>are</em>. To avoid duplicate content and awkward linking, it was important for me to manage my text files in a single space, one Obsidian vault.</li>
<li>I have a tendency to tinker a lot on my website. This can make it so that I spend more time trying out new things and changing the design than I do writing. Having my code base and content separated helps me focus more on writing things that are meaningful to me.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-things-i-havent-figured-out-yet">Some things I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is it worthwhile for me to publish more granular IndieWeb post types such as notes and likes? Do I care about them? Am I making them only to show them? What&rsquo;s their value if I cannot automate this process? Does the technical implementation change if I push said content to a git repository that consists of only notes?</li>
<li>What does a proper dark mode look like?</li>
<li>Do I want to continue my barebones experiment and document the discomfort of vanity? Or am I ready for something more modern?</li>
<li>How in the world do I even go about Micropub and Webmentions?</li>
</ul>

      <p>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work for me, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.</p>
<p>I finished reading <em>The Midnight Library</em>, which I had borrowed from <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">Annelie</a>. It sure has been a long time since I last read a book that was both so entertaining and easygoing. It feels borderline young adult, and entirely unpretentious.</p>

      <p>Each year I&rsquo;m less embarrassed to say it: I don&rsquo;t like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Day and Liberation Day, and I&rsquo;ve found it really messes with my head. I don&rsquo;t mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.</p>
<p>This week, I learn that bolognese is a great base for chili, as long as you add enough cumin, beef, and beer. We watch <em>The Undoing</em>, which is a surprisingly great decision of Hugh Grant.</p>

      <p>Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.</p>
<p>I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know <em>everything</em> about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak. He laughs when I bop his nose, although I quickly learn that the force with which I bop Anja&rsquo;s adult nose shan&rsquo;t be applied here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a French bakery in Amsterdam that I visit on Wednesday with my colleague Ruby. Since their actual oven is somewhere else, I wonder if the shop even calls itself a bakery. After all, French standards would forbid it. The caramel √©clair reminds me of that time at <a href="https://www.un-dimanche-a-paris.com/">Un Dimanche √† Paris</a>, a high I&rsquo;ve been chasing since mid-2018. The bread has been in the window too long. I ask if they have plastic bags, and I&rsquo;m told no. I say I think that should be illegal in bakeries.</p>
<p>My childhood friend Mathilde comes for dinner on Sunday. Anja and I are giddy with excitement. In preparation, we practice our harmonies to Alanis Morissette&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ironic&quot;over voice messages. Her husband asks her if she, too, heard the cat meowing. We&rsquo;re celebrating her birthday, and I got her gifts at <a href="http://www.javabookshop.nl/">Java Bookshop</a>. When I ask them about the East-Asian gay guy who writes letters to his mom, they immediately give me Ocean Vuong&rsquo;s new book of poetry. Seeing her again, I better understand what It means to have a soulmate. I sing so loud I give myself a migraine. It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">mdx</a> in case I ever needed some more complexity in my content files. I would mostly update content through my desktop client, but have <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a> for iOS installed, which I enjoy as much as anyone could enjoy a touchscreen Git client. I was missing some functionalities that are natural to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault. I could make a spiel about how I love the &ldquo;slow web&rdquo;-ness of writing things on my phone and only publishing them when I&rsquo;m on my computer, but I simply haven&rsquo;t figured out how to do it any other way.</p>

      <p>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I&rsquo;m having trouble understanding whether I&rsquo;m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I&rsquo;ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.</p>
<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>Leeruniek&rsquo;s Product team is hiring, and I&rsquo;ve been the one taking care of the recruitment process for two engineering and one design role. So far, I&rsquo;ve found a new front-end engineer as well as a designer within two months, so I suppose you could say I&rsquo;ve been busy. If this process has been teaching me anything new, it&rsquo;s that 1) I very much enjoy meeting people and learning about their (work) life stories, 2) there is such value in building strong relationships with recruiters who make you smile, and 3) it takes two weeks of introdutory chats before I begin to regret having to listen to my own voice give the same pitch over and over again.</p>
<h3 id="at-home">At home</h3>
<p>Another secret blessing of Covid has been the ability to spend more time at home, which, for me, immediately translates to the ability to better consider how I value my home environment. We&rsquo;ve been churning through a pretty long list of home improvement projects, the absolute highlight so far having been installing a projector and theatre screen in the living room. Last weekend, we finished most of the work on our kitchen remodelling by putting in new counter tops.</p>
<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<p>A while ago, we found some new recipes that we&rsquo;ve enjoyed refining:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2016/04/25/tartines-quiche-potato-crusted/">Tartine‚Äôs Quiche, Potato Crusted</a> by Alexandra Stafford, which is great in itself but will be even better with a thicker crust</li>
<li><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2019/05/17/spring-fattoush-salad/">Spring Fattoush Salad</a>, also by Alexandra Stafford, which is quite likely the best salad I&rsquo;ve ever had. I&rsquo;ve had it with Namiko Hirasawa Chen&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/teriyaki-salmon-recipe/">teriyaki salmon</a> and it is simply divine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of Dutch documentaries on the effects Internet culture has on children. <a href="https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/collecties/themas/toekomst/internet.html">2doc</a> has a selection. I particularly enjoyed <em>My Daughter, the Vlogger</em>. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like to raise a child, and I can&rsquo;t imagine what it would be like in 2022. Still, &ldquo;all her peers will have a YouTube channel by the time they are six, she might as well get a leg up&rdquo; sounds sad coming out of the mouth of a 3-year-old&rsquo;s mother.</p>

      <p>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we&rsquo;re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you &ldquo;leave it cleaner than you found it&rdquo; and make sure you&rsquo;re gone after two days. At this point, we&rsquo;re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining &ldquo;Bonsoihoir&rdquo;. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, &ldquo;no, not for champagne, just for the drinks&rdquo;. I also really don&rsquo;t like ticks, and I simply can&rsquo;t imagine that Norway somehow doesn&rsquo;t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve begun hosting dinner parties again. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022421-bulgogi-eggplant">Eggplant bulgogi</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/">roasted squash with soy-glazed gingery tofu</a> make for a great Asian fusion. With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.</p>
<p>At work, I&rsquo;m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I&rsquo;m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I&rsquo;ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite&rsquo;s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn&rsquo;t even think of it myself.</p>
<p>On Sunday I watched a few horror films, <em>Midsommar</em> being the favorite. I also watched <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2022), which wasn&rsquo;t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of <em>Killing Eve</em>, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin r√©sum√© aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.</p>

      <p>I never get much reading done unless I&rsquo;m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I&rsquo;m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>
<p>Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It&rsquo;s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I&rsquo;m feeling like a million bucks.</p>
<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I&rsquo;ve limited myself to one: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a></em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she&rsquo;s going. Every now and then, I&rsquo;ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>
<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find this book a bit&hellip; <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines&hellip; It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A&rsquo;s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn&rsquo;t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>

      <p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>
<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>
<p>By now it is such a clich√© to even say it, but I don&rsquo;t like the monolith that we&rsquo;ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn&rsquo;t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>
<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I&rsquo;ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

      <p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co">Vine &amp; Fig</a>&rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>
<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: ‚ÄúWhatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.‚Äù If you‚Äôre not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don‚Äôt make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>
<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>
<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, this is not the first draft,‚Äù she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, ‚Äúthe first one was me basically begging to be loved.‚Äù From where I&rsquo;m sitting, I can see that this isn&rsquo;t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They&rsquo;ve been waiting for &ldquo;this phase&rdquo; to end for years. In their household, there is simply no &ldquo;love for the gays&rdquo;. It took a conversation with our friend&rsquo;s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need your parents as much as you think you do‚Äù the woman had said.</p>
<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>
<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

      <p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>
<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canel√©s, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they&rsquo;re too bready.</p>
<p>In the window of Meijssen they&rsquo;re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They&rsquo;re surprisingly good.</p>

      <p>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I&rsquo;m a part, a White lesbian asked me: &ldquo;when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like <em>me</em> join?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great questions,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;my response is identical to what you would say if someone went &lsquo;why do you need lesbian bars? You don&rsquo;t see me going to a straight bar, do you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough&rdquo; said the White lesbian.</p>
<p>I found an app called <a href="https://liberatemeditation.com/">Liberate</a>. It has beautiful meditations by Black and Indigenous teachers. I&rsquo;ve always been a Headspace fan. Despite founder Andy&rsquo;s cringey &ldquo;I lived with the monks so you didn&rsquo;t have to&rdquo; marketing strategy, I appreciate the app for its interface and quality content. It hadn&rsquo;t occured to me that the experiences I have as an Afropean could find their place in a meditation practice.</p>
<p>Part of me feels too indulgent for enjoying Liberate as much as I do. Listening to meditation teachers who have the understanding that microagressions are an actual reality in my actual life is just so different and amazing. Still, my subconscious feels sorry for the theoretical White people who would be uncomfortable if they found out I listen to Black meditations. <em>Why even bring your identity into it?!</em> Like a lesbian momentarily forgetting she&rsquo;s allowed her lesbian bar.</p>

      <p>The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I&rsquo;m at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/stfyFKAKsWndZSBA6">Basquiat</a> waiting to catch up with a friend, and an Irish woman strikes up a conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can&rsquo;t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sneezes, and I remark how, since March 2020, &ldquo;gesundheit&rdquo; has been replaced by dirty looks. &ldquo;I need my allergy meds&rdquo; she says, in her voice a hint of embarrassment. Then she tells me about her successes of late: she and the old English Bulldog next to her have finally begun frequenting the neighborhood bars again, the ones &ldquo;where everyone recognizes them&rdquo;. She&rsquo;s also been making lots of new friends. She suspects it&rsquo;s the sign she&rsquo;s been sporting on her mobility scooter, which reads <em>if I die because of Covid, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so sorry for all the young people, you know? One of them told me they were scared to go out and party, fearing their reckless behavior would kill their grandparents. You know what I told him? I told him it wasn&rsquo;t his fault. And you know what? He fell into my arms crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently, she hasn&rsquo;t missed a single Sunday protest on Museum Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really insane, the weaponry and violence that are on standby on Sundays. I&rsquo;m from Belfast, you know, so you could say I&rsquo;ve been around the block a few times. Even in Belfast, during our protests, they only pulled out weapons when things got really tough. Here, it seems that&rsquo;s their only strategy. And I&rsquo;m from Belfast, go figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening, Anja and I go to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xxuU3M4o5Ew9FRMG8">Dignita Hoftuin</a>{:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, where our friends Evelyn and Sander plan to announce their elopement in Kopenhagen earlier this week. Upon arrival, before I&rsquo;ve been able to discern whether I&rsquo;d like to consent to anything, I receive a warm hug from my friend, and a handshake from a total stranger.</p>
<p>What makes the pandemic such a fickle game is that nobody looks like they&rsquo;re infected. Everyone who breaches my personal space looks kind. Still, the Delta variant is coming for us, and I&rsquo;m surprised by how much my conservatism sticks out like a sore thumb everywhere I go.</p>

    <content>
      <p>On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, completing our visit with Anneli and Milan, I said calmly to Anja:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I may try not drinking for a week or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter. The father is an excellent home chef, and so we quickly bonded over soul food, shared political views, and wine.</p>
<p>Alcohol wasn&rsquo;t on my mind at all. I didn&rsquo;t drink more than three glasses of red during my entire stay with them. Instead, Anja and I were just&hellip; part of their warm family dynamic. Eating jubileumskaka for breakfast, reading stories before bed. I was overwhelmed by how secure I felt in their presence, so much so that I cried when we left. It was a week to remember. Looking back, I can see that it must have been this sudden sense of security, entirely unfamiliar to my person, that made me realize what I needed.</p>
<h3 id="embracing-sobriety">Embracing sobriety</h3>
<p>That one week of not drinking has yet to end (and I don&rsquo;t plan for it to). Those first few months after our Stockholm trip, not drinking was embarrassingly easy. I had done it before, and Anja doesn&rsquo;t really ever drink, and so our dinner parties, get-togethers, and outings were never awkward for me. I didn&rsquo;t even celebrate my one year of not drinking because it just&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t a thing to me. I didn&rsquo;t even feel like I was sober. Not until the email.</p>
<p>I have a dear childhood friend who is as troubled a soul as I was for a long time. I&rsquo;m not saying that to sound like a know-it-all, I&rsquo;m just in a different place now. They have a habit of only reaching out to me when they&rsquo;re doing well, and so whenever things are rough, they fall off my radar. We hadn&rsquo;t spoken in a while and when they did in the late Fall of 2018, the good news was that they were entering into rehab. The bad news had been that they had fallen homeless and that they were battling a coke addiction on top of  what I had already identified as a dependency on other substances.</p>
<p>By the time Valentine&rsquo;s Day of 2019 rolled around, I received an email from their sister with the invitation to write my friend an intervention letter. They would be using mine, as well as those of another friend and a few relatives to support my friend&rsquo;s treatment program.</p>
<h3 id="sobriety-means-alcoholic">Sobriety means alcoholic</h3>
<p>My first draft of the letter was ready within the hour. I&rsquo;ve always been at ease with writing, and so putting into words what my friend&rsquo;s addiction had done to me was fairly easy. I let Anja read the letter right away. Once she finished, she looked up at me with a face full of discomfort. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; I asked her. After hesitating for a few moments, she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you won&rsquo;t be mad when I tell you this, but I don&rsquo;t think this is entirely true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t mad. I just didn&rsquo;t really understand what she was talking about. My letter was heartfelt and kind, hopeful and supporting, and I had explained to my friend how their drinking made them an untrustworthy friend, how their asking for money was awkward, and how much it hurt. Anja saw more than that.</p>
<p>Slowly, she started uncovering some truths that I hadn&rsquo;t ever acknowledged, at least not to their full extent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I recall you making comments about their drinking and drug use quite often, when in reality your relationship with alcohol isn&rsquo;t super healthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had known that for some time. Heck, I hadn&rsquo;t even had a drink in almost a year. Not drinking comes with a few perks, though. One of them is that you don&rsquo;t have to acknowledge that your drinking is actually a problem. That day was the first day that I realized that my relationship with alcohol makes me an alcoholic. I was in such denial about that for so long that my childhood friend&rsquo;s problems had come to function as a lightning rod.</p>
<h3 id="filling-in-the-blanks-i-had-forgotten-were-there">Filling in the blanks I had forgotten were there</h3>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve emotionally transitioned from being simply dry to being sober, a whole new world has opened up. I get to look at my family&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol with much more clarity. I can see how alcohol was my ultimate vice in battling feelings of unworthiness, and how it oddly enough magnified those feelings. My subconscious is slowly filling in the blanks that I had forgotten were there. To me, alcohol equates forgetting, forgetting, forgetting. So much forgetting, in fact, that I didn&rsquo;t even know how much I&rsquo;m supposed to remember.</p>
<h3 id="what-needs-mending">What needs mending</h3>
<p>With a minimized dependency on alcohol, I have started to work on things that have been with me for decades. And I have a sobriety counter on my watch. I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> the reminder every day, but I want it. I think of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/philip-seymour-hoffmans-last-days-77972/">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>{:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} a <em>lot</em>. After successfully completing their rehab program, my childhood friend is back on drugs again, and supporting themselves with escort work. There&rsquo;s a very fine line between me and that. For a long time I thought it was studying it in detail and deriving life lessons from it. Today, I celebrate 1095 days of making the right decision, and a little over two years of turning inward to see what needs mending.</p>

      <p>I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I&rsquo;ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I&rsquo;ve made it through two seasons of <em>Love After Lockup</em> and six seasons of <em>Sister Wives</em>. It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I don&rsquo;t want <em>Sister Wives</em> to end.</p>
<p>I watched the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL3Jz8fDgFI">Them</a></em> and it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to decide I wasn&rsquo;t going to watch the series, despite how much I love Lena Waithe. People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think I&rsquo;m ready for <a href="https://audacity.substack.com/p/reality-is-horror-enough">Black narratives that don&rsquo;t <em>just</em> center around the entertainment of collective and private trauma of Black people</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the process of perfecting our tossed pasta recipe.</p>

      <p>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I&rsquo;ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn&rsquo;t always able to execute on them.</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I&rsquo;ve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off</li>
<li>Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in</li>
<li>Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed</li>
<li>Walk for one hour</li>
<li>Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk</li>
<li>Arrive home and update YNAB</li>
<li>Plan my day</li>
<li>Empty my email inbox</li>
<li>Make a smoothie</li>
<li>Start my daily meetings</li>

      <p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren&rsquo;t assigned at birth.</p>
<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use &ldquo;she&rdquo;, but really I&rsquo;ll listen to anything that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;it&rdquo;. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn&rsquo;t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the &ldquo;she&rdquo; that I was assigned at birth?</p>
<p>Yes, but also&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind &ldquo;she&rdquo;. To me, &ldquo;she&rdquo; is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a &ldquo;she&rdquo;, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>
<p>Being called &ldquo;she&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as &ldquo;she&rdquo;, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It&rsquo;s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn&rsquo;t use the same defition of &ldquo;she&rdquo; as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>

    <content>
      <p>When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.</p>
<p>For the past five years, I&rsquo;ve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates. There&rsquo;s a skate store around the block from my house, and whenever I&rsquo;d pass it, I&rsquo;d find myself right back in the best part of my childhood. For five years, though, I never got around to actually buying them.</p>
<p>Until Covid.</p>
<p>Much like what seems everyone in Amsterdam and their grandmother, I&rsquo;ve finally purchased a nice pair of skates. I got FR freeskates with three 110mm wheels as well as the protection gear I was always too cool to wear as a child. And when I say &ldquo;everyone and their grandmother&rdquo;, I mean enough people to keep me waiting for those skates for two weeks.</p>
<p>As a person who appreciates the (near-)instant gratification of next-day-delivery, waiting two weeks for a purchase to arrive seemed like an eternity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did with that eternity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched at least ten hours of freeskating flow videos</li>
<li>Contemplated whether I should cancel my order and find less amazing skates that would arrive sooner</li>
<li>Reminisce about how awesome skating felt when I was a child</li>
</ul>
<p>It was probably due to all this reminiscing that the concept of skating turned into an activity that you can&rsquo;t unlearn, much like biking. My body remembered all the slides I could do, and the countless ways to stop. I figured I&rsquo;d be able to take my skates out to the park within the first week or so.</p>
<p>Then they arrived.</p>
<p>Yesterday, twenty years afer I last skated, I unboxed and attempted to get into the skates. It took 30 minutes to figure out how to unlock the cuffs alone. Then it took ten minutes per skate to get the things on my feet. I&rsquo;ve been awkwardly rolling around the living room ever since, grabbing onto chairs and door frames, unsure of which muscles I need to keep from falling and breaking off my front teeth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nowhere near old enough to complain about aging or being too old for shit, but at 33, I&rsquo;m slowly embracing the concept of micro-aging. From time to time, I will meet something that confirms that my body, my mind, and my experiences have changed drastically from what they were when I was a child. From time to time, something will remind me that I&rsquo;m no longer 17, and right now, skating is it.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I&rsquo;m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work is so great!&rdquo; I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn&rsquo;t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through <em>1984</em>. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says &ldquo;like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s, like, just typically English&rdquo;, and we both smile.</p>
<p>After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A&rsquo;s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.</p>
<p>On Thursday, my <a href="/now">Now</a> page is published on <a href="https://nownownow.com/p/Tptv">nownownow.com</a>. After a beautiful day at the home office, I&rsquo;m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don&rsquo;t need her parentification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.</p>
<p>I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649692/"><em>Surviving Death</em></a> episodes on mediums. A tells me she&rsquo;s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.</p>
<p>On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven&rsquo;t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.</p>

      <p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br>
you know it‚Äôs another one<br>
‚ÄúTrans Life Survivors‚Äù<br>
says the cover<br>
‚ÄúMerry Christmas!‚Äù<br>
says your sister<br>
you have only been using<br>
they/them pronouns<br>
in private<br>
for a year or so<br>
it‚Äôll look so beautiful next to<br>
the ex-gay book<br>
your other sister presented to you<br>
on your birthday last month</p>
<p>At family dinner you<br>
spend bathroom breaks in your<br>
childhood bedroom<br>
five in total<br>
logging on to talk to us<br>
about how the heavy things feel<br>
being the punching bag<br>
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br>
practises her right hook<br>
screaming fire about<br>
her trans classmate<br>
stings<br>
and<br>
it stings<br>
like a shattered jaw</p>
<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br>
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br>
Covid-style<br>
each of the siblings hosting<br>
the entire family<br>
for a portion of the day<br>
hopping from house to house<br>
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br>
a big family will<br>
At the fourth stop you are full<br>
zonking off into the distance<br>
catching the smiling face of your<br>
sister-in-law on the way there<br>
and you remember what<br>
it felt like when<br>
she wouldn‚Äôt come to
your lesbian wedding</p>
<p>For you and them<br>
there is no Family<br>
not since you came out as non-binary<br>
and your parents<br>
yelled<br>
‚Äúcheck please‚Äù<br>
the only trace of<br>
those you came from<br>
is the card your grandmother sent<br>
She writes ‚ÄúI wanted you to<br>
know I support you‚Äù<br>
She is a sweetheart<br>
it is a teardrop in the desert<br>
that you cling to</p>
<p>Your father was no exception<br>
first the pandemic<br>
now the respirator<br>
the store has been extra busy these days<br>
but you‚Äôre getting by<br>
it‚Äôs keeping your mind off<br>
of how much he was hoping<br>
you‚Äôll find a girl someday soon<br>
Today, the phone call<br>
from the hospital<br>
lets you know that<br>
he can come home for Christmas<br>
The disappointment you feel<br>
sits in your body like a monster</p>
<p>You have all the time in the world<br>
to tell me how you‚Äôre doing<br>
but not a moment to yourself<br>
to commit to the act<br>
with all those relatives in the house<br>
prone to restricting themselves to<br>
those parts of the Bible<br>
that make Christianity look easy<br>
and you being back<br>
in the home of your youth<br>
after the attempt<br>
confirms what you fear and<br>
what your parents have been saying<br>
is true about your life<br>
‚ÄúI have no love for the gays in my heart‚Äù<br>
your father said<br>
You wonder how gay<br>
he knows you are<br>
I wonder where you‚Äôve hidden<br>
the Pride flag that I sent you<br>
as a housewarming gift</p>
<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of HaShem is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don‚Äôt let the bastards grind you down.</p>

    <content>
      <p>When I first learned that ‚Äòpontifex‚Äô, Pope Francis‚Äô Twitter account, is Latin for ‚Äòbridge builder‚Äô, I was entirely delighted. ‚ÄúHow wonderful‚Äù, I thought, ‚Äúthat our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.‚Äù</p>
<p>When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I‚Äôm part of the leadership team at Vine &amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics. When it comes to the bridge between us and the rest of the world, I focus most of my efforts on building not the bridge‚Äôs deck but its foundation. The part that contains the strong back and self love required to even begin thinking about making it to the deck, which is where all the difficult dialogues happen. You know, the ones about whether or not we‚Äôre inherently disordered and whether we should ever experience physical intimacy.</p>
<p>This image of a bridge stretching from the feet of one group to another fits in beautifully with my theology. That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Law, the rest is commentary.</p>
<p>My fantasy of pontifical bridges stretching from one people to the next was quite short-lived. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bridge between mankind and God, babe, not Catholics and everybody else‚Äù, my partner mumbled. An anti-clerical lesbian raised on the feminism of her Jewish hippie mom, she doesn‚Äôt own a pair of rosy glasses polished by my warm memories of Christmas-time pews overflowing with chilly bodies in warm coats. The Church does not invoke tender feelings of heritage for her. Wikipedia told me she was right about where that bridge leads.</p>
<p>While our Pope is our bridge, he is also a model. He reminds us, simply by showing up, that we must strive for a connection with God; one that will help us believe the correct thing and do what is righteous, so that we will not be forgotten when the time comes. We dream, for ourselves and for our neighbors, of bridges, thick as concrete, paved smoothly with whatever pleases HaShem as well as our abstinence from sin. We have that light, and by God, we will bring salvation to the ends of the Earth.</p>
<p>Today, as we read Romans 10, which is to say Paul‚Äôs conversion strategy for the Jews and Gentiles, we get to meditate on that light, and how beautiful it is that we can share it with our neighbors. In the days of the men who wrote what we‚Äôve come to know as the Pauline Epistles, the act of embracing Gentiles and Jews alike in the image of Christ must have been such a beautiful, tender aspiration. Today, however, their words evoke something different altogether. They remind me that those of us who don‚Äôt think the Epistle to the Romans should come with a trigger warning, simply haven‚Äôt spent enough time with actual Jews. Or really any person who has felt the foot of the Church on their own foot.</p>
<p>See, there‚Äôs a thing us Christians are primed to overlook when we engage with the world, filled with the warmth of Jesus: we are taught to long for that strong spiritual connection with The Above so fervently, that we often do it at the expense of whoever else is with us in The Below. Why do so many of our bridges lean on the backs of others?</p>
<p>Tell the Jews the Messiah has already come and how they‚Äôre missing out. Make sure you make ‚Äòem really feel it. Take their book and forget it was ever even theirs. Don‚Äôt vaccinate. Don‚Äôt gay. Choose purity culture over an actual human‚Äôs life, choose a pastor over a child. Choose a child over a woman, choose one color over the others. Go to Africa and do things so that you feel charitable. Go anywhere but home to help your neighbor.</p>
<p>As we welcome the Season of advent ‚Äî and truly, I hope it will fill our sore hearts with anticipation and longing ‚Äî I want to begin reimagining the bridge between myself and God. May it be paved with whatever pleases Her as well as my abstinence from sin. May it remind me that I am allowed a seat at the table, and that this table is one to share. May my bridge be made up of all the bridges I build between myself and my neighbors, so that we may travel between this island and another.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I&rsquo;m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people&rsquo;s bodies. My Jewish partner will do the eye roll of eye rolls and say: ‚Äúfunny how you all kind of <em>do that</em>, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?‚Äù</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right: we Christians have a peculiar propensity for thinking ourselves better than the rest. And I&rsquo;m not talking communal, but rather individual superiority. It&rsquo;s really quite basic. We all have our individual interpretation of what signifies the core and what is merely peripheral in God‚Äôs message to the people. I may very well believe that God&rsquo;s love can triumph when we give queer people room to breathe (which is to say to live, love, and all that comes with it), but another equally Christian Christian may think this triumph of love requires the exact opposite response. Despite this reality, we deem ourselves the Good Follower, and the other one Not A Real Christian.</p>
<p>Hell is other people.</p>
<p>When I open my Bible to Ezekiel 34, I hear the echo of the Parable of the Lost Sheep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSuppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn‚Äôt he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‚ÄòRejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.‚Äô I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s something so tender and kind in both these texts; no matter who or where or how lost, we are all equally important to God. Even when we sin, through repentance we can be found again. But who is a sinner and who needs repentance?</p>
<p>To many people in the flock, the entire Vine &amp; Fig community is a sinner in need of repentance. Disguised as well-intended good Christian ministry, their anti-queer violence saturates our daily lives. And let‚Äôs be clear: when I say violence, I don&rsquo;t just mean the 350 trans and gender diverse individuals who were murdered in the past twelve months. I mean your brother who didn&rsquo;t come to your wedding, and your mother who keeps saying she &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t believe in gender diversity&rdquo;. I mean your employer who forces you to sign a document indicating that you condemn homosexuality while you try to hide your girlfriend from your Instagram timeline. I mean the godawful things your siblings parrot over Sunday supper, and your father reminding them all that he has no love in his heart for gay people.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs great that you have your flock, my man, but should we queer people even want to be a part of it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to think ‚Äòyes‚Äô.</p>
<p>Because hell is other people, and during our journey towards them we encounter God. When I dive deeper into Ezekiel 34 and the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the words take on a new meaning. To me, they are not a personal consolation, reminding me that I will be found if I‚Äôm lost. They tell me, above anything, that I am part of a single enormous flock, made up of everyone, filled with people whom I think are lost, and who, in turn, believe that I&rsquo;ve gone astray. The passage tells me to love God above all else, and my neighbor as myself. Even if that neighbor is keeping their foot on my foot.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat might that love look like?‚Äù we all rightfully ask, immediately. In my case, love may be a ‚Äòyes‚Äô and it may be a ‚Äòno‚Äô.</p>
<p>A ‚Äúyes, you are right, thank you for teaching me about yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Or a ‚Äúno, what you are saying about me and my siblings is false, destructive, and traumatizing. Here, let me help you see things through a new lens so that we can coexist.‚Äù</p>
<p>Through God, I am granted the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <p>After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to <a href="https://airtrade.com">Airtrade</a>. This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we&rsquo;ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What&rsquo;s more, five years is a good run, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My next adventure is taking me even deeper into making tools for people at work, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled. I&rsquo;m joining <a href="https://leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>, a startup creating data-driven educational technology. They&rsquo;re a smaller team than what I worked with the past five years, and I&rsquo;m curious to see what impact that has on the way I work.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting challenges to take care of at Leeruniek, and I&rsquo;m eager to get my hands dirty!</p>

    <content>
      <p>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause c√©l√®bre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that ‚ÄúGod loves your children as they are‚Äù and ‚Äúthe church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.‚Äù ‚Äî <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->America Magazine<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn&rsquo;t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions. My most vivid recollection of the Church&rsquo;s stance on sexual matters is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JP II blaming the child abuse horror on the gays<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Since I became involved in queer Catholic collective <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vine &amp; Fig<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have learnt something about myself and that is that I am very privileged. While many of my queer Catholic siblings fight daily battles for their identities and experiences with the people in their homes and lives, I&rsquo;m only a single Pride Week removed from walking into Sunday Mass in a three-piece rainbow suit and a pink yarmulke.</p>
<p>Because of this privileged confidence, I appreciate the shout-out, but I have no need for it. I know that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God &ldquo;endorsed&rdquo; LGBTQ+ people when he created us. ‚Äî <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Nightingale<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, to most affirming queer Catholics everywhere, Pope Francis&rsquo; message was a godsend.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Pope Francis certainly is not the first religious person to say that we queer individuals are children of God. Many affirming religious institutions, organizations, and individuals paved the way for him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something here that requires our close attention.</p>
<p>Welcoming-yet-staunchly-anti-queer congregations, Christians evangelizing &lsquo;hate the sin, love the sinner&rsquo; rhetoric, and conversion &rsquo;therapy&rsquo; programmes have been saying that we are loved by God for decades. Their message doesn&rsquo;t ever usher in the paradigm shift we hope for. Much rather, it invites queer people to be vulnerable, and then once we are, things take a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Queer people are children of God&rsquo; can be a godsend, <em>and</em> it can be a dog whistle. A poetic way of saying &lsquo;oh it&rsquo;s okay to <em>be</em> queer, it&rsquo;s just very wrong to do it&rsquo;, without having to take full responsibility for the origin and ramifications of your anti-queerness. After all, if your conviction is that queerness is a character flaw and not a glorious attribute inextricably connected to the soul, then technically you&rsquo;re not lying. It&rsquo;s a simple &lsquo;Queer people are children of God, they just need to be saved&rsquo;, if you want it to be.</p>
<p>This particular form of anti-queerness has the potential to be much more damaging than the odd &lsquo;hey you, dyke!&rsquo; I may receive in the streets of Amsterdam. It reels us in and makes us believe we are safe. It is reminiscent of the dad in <em>Get Out</em>, who would&rsquo;ve voted for Obama a third time but who also performs horror procedures on Black humans in his basement. It&rsquo;s reminiscent of the friendly, middle-aged, Austrian trumpet player who has a nazi shrine for a basement in <em>Im Keller</em>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The church loves our children as they are&rsquo; unsettles me, because I have been on the receiving end of an anti-queerness (and a racism, for that matter) that is very friendly and welcoming at face value. Its eventual uncanniness is <em>terrifying</em>. I want to know what&rsquo;s in the basement. And as you know: with every good story, there&rsquo;s always a basement.</p>

      <p>Amsterdam&rsquo;s patient zero is a woman who just happens to have spent early 2020 in the north of Italy. She has a son who attends the high school which just happens to be Anja&rsquo;s place of employment. Anja is the first person I know to be infected with Covid 19. I am the second.</p>
<p>Working in travel technology, my experience of the outbreak of Covid 19 was colored by coworkers wondering by the water cooler what all the fuss was about. The most vocal among them are Rotterdammers, a people known, if anything, for its no-nonsense approach to trouble.</p>
<p>Anja and I have a different disposition. Both of us have sensitive danger antennas. They were activated on numerous occasions since late last year, with us getting increasingly more worried every time the word &ldquo;Covid&rdquo; was mentioned on the news.</p>
<p>Still, by early March, I was coming into the office every day, telling myself I was being too cautious. Until one day&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking back, I suppose I&rsquo;m lucky to have one colleague with an immunocompromised wife. I&rsquo;ll never forget the way he leaned back in his chair when I came closer to ask him a question. Rightly so, it turned out, because within a day Anja developed a cough I had never heard before in my life.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine, but travel back with me to the beginning of this year. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine, this virus won&rsquo;t reach us. And if it does, it&rsquo;s not life-threatening for most of society&rdquo; the government said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you please stop calling, ma&rsquo;am? I&rsquo;ve told you before it&rsquo;s just a mild flu for people your age, and we won&rsquo;t be able to do anything for you anyway if you come in&rdquo;, my doctor&rsquo;s assistant said.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until two weeks in that Anja was invited to come to a pop-up testing facility. Not the ones we have now, but a doctor&rsquo;s office somewhere in Amsterdam that had been turned into a quarantine zone, people in white suits everywhere. Two weeks after that, we had an appointment at the hospital, which had built a testing facility in the parking lot. I waited outside in a tent with a heater as Anja underwent a battery of tests.</p>
<p>The man who went in before her was admitted to the ICU. I prayed rosary after rosary, wondering how in the world I&rsquo;d get the car home without a license. What felt like hours was really 18 minutes when Anja walked out of the facility. Her cough was terrible, but it wasn&rsquo;t long Covid. Meanwhile, my Covid was barely a sniffle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a while, I used Instagram to chronicle our experiences. I was getting hundreds of messages a day, and sharing little stories on the platform was a quicker way of updating everyone. I was just going through the archive and noticed that, at some point, the Covid-themed stories just stopped. It&rsquo;s because, after six weeks or so, Anja slowly started to feel better.</p>
<p>No long Covid, no long-lasting results, a little bit of tiredness. We&rsquo;re okay again. Life continues as normal, except that everything is different. The travel industry has plummeted into a deep, deep crisis. The end of the school year was bizarre, and we&rsquo;re enjoying the Summer with walks in the park and watching television. Anticipating that my career might be ready for a change, I&rsquo;ve been busy applying for new jobs, and I just signed a new contract.</p>
<p>Nothing is the same.</p>
<p>But at least we&rsquo;re okay. People around us have been getting ill, severely ill, some of them dying. Working from home isn&rsquo;t ideal, specifically because we&rsquo;ve turned our little shoebox of a living room into a two-person office, but we&rsquo;re getting by. We have each other, and we have <em>Ratched</em>.</p>

      <p><em>This was <a href="https://vineandfig.co/blog/2020/pray-tell-clobber">originally published</a> as part of the Vine &amp; Fig &ldquo;Pray Tell&rdquo; project.</em></p>
<p>She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‚ÄòHey dear!‚Äô it sounds. ‚ÄòHappy Mother‚Äôs Day&rsquo;, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn‚Äôt have imagined that Mother‚Äôs Day was going to be like this.</p>
<p>As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother‚Äôs Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again. The anniversary of his death is next week. Given the trajectory of my life, celebrating my mother‚Äôs parenting abilities seems ridiculous, but given the calendar, keeping a distance between us on this very day seems cruel.</p>
<p>As the daughter of my mother, I am two individuals. I am at once the person she wants to see, the one who overcame childhood troubles to arrive in adulthood a loving and supportive daughter. Also, though, I am the adult who just graduated from over two decades of therapy, someone who is active in those corners of Reddit where people go to discuss parental emotional abuse. My attachment to both of my parents is so disturbed that close contact is not really possible.</p>
<p>I remind myself vaguely of my expat friends, the gay ones who came to Amsterdam to escape their queerphobic countries. When they talk on the phone with their parents, they have to ignore so many parts of their personality that they become other people. They don‚Äôt really have a choice.</p>
<p>And I do, at least, this much I‚Äôm told by the Catechism of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>After all, a good Catholic is someone who honors their father and mother. Sometimes, after working myself into a frenzy thinking about this, I research Catholic teachings on the healthy and God-loving child-parent relationship. My clobber passages are not the ones about queerness. They are those verses that tell me that children who don‚Äôt provide for their parents are worse than unbelievers. That it pleases HaShem when I obey my mother in everything. I don‚Äôt experience any spiritual rewards of peace and prosperity when I honor my parents the way the Bible (or society) teaches me. I experience the opposite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jews have the same teachings, you know&rsquo; my favorite person will say. &lsquo;Really?!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, you&hellip; stole our book, remember?&rsquo; it will follow, jokingly but only because there&rsquo;s truth in most jokes. Two things are true, she says. &lsquo;One: biological parents aren&rsquo;t the only ones doing the parenting. Take Grandma Dora, for example. You always tell me how safe and welcome you felt in her home. Now that is a parent.&rsquo; &lsquo;And two?&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll ask, hopeful. &lsquo;Two: it‚Äôs up to you to decide what constitutes honoring your parents. Either you can decide, or you can be miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying.</p>

      <p>Our friends gave birth to their first child, Eleanor! She was born on a trip east, and had to spend some time at the hospital. They sent us a wonderful photograph of her reaching out from her hospital crib. I simply <em>had</em> to commemorate.</p>

      <p>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March">Women&rsquo;s March</a>. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often attend protests, not in the last place because I&rsquo;m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what&rsquo;s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can&rsquo;t be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.</p>
<p>What a time to be alive.</p>

She has been sleeping poorly lately; I say &ldquo;lately&rdquo; but I only met her last month, so I don&rsquo;t know what her sleep hygiene is, although she says &ldquo;it has improved since I began falling asleep in your arms&rdquo;. I imagine how she sleeps on the plane, entertaining the other passengers, cabin crew, and pilots with her stupefyingly loud snores.</p>

Filmmaker Thomas Vroege attempts to understand his motives.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2600742/"><em>Ghost Shark</em></a>, in which the translucent, bright blue ghost of a murdered shark jumps up from the smallest water surfaces to eat innocent holiday goers, is the worst worst Syfy-film of 2013. With a comeback from¬†<em>7th Heaven</em>‚Äòs youngest daughter. Totally worth the choke by laughter, though.</li>
<li>I think Noah Kalina‚Äôs photo series¬†<a href="http://noahkalina.com/36/39#1"><em>Internet/Sex (2007-2009)</em></a>¬†is something very special.</li>
<li>My poet friend Jelmer van Lenteren runs a very nice¬†<a href="http://ikzitookop.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, where he shares his beautiful work and many great music tips.</li>

      <p>The only journal I‚Äôve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called <a href="https://www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com">www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com</a>. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.</p>
<p>The problem with my offline photo journalling habit was that I could never enjoy looking at my photos. There were no visuals to support my Finder, and I loved seeing them come together when arranged in a certain way. So, for approximately five years I didn‚Äôt really look at any of the photographs I took.</p>
<p>Today, a tiny new chapter opens up with the birth of a new website dedicated to these photographs. I‚Äôm in the process of selecting the ones I love most from 2005-now, and publishing them in a horizontal fashion. They‚Äôre relatively small, always have to be seen in relation to each other, and are created by a collection of cameras. They were taken for a number of reasons; many for clients, but even more for my personal gratification.</p>
<p>As of now the website is located at <a href="http://zinzygeene.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, but that will most likely change to a more personalized address. I‚Äôm contemplating using <em>zinzygeene.nl</em>, which I think is always a joke when it comes to a serious portfolio website, or another one I have registered. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I&rsquo;ve taken it down because I can&rsquo;t get over Tumblr&rsquo;s problem with ownership.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Yesterday, as I swiped through my digital September issue of Wired, I came across a bit that immediately swung me back right into my first year of high school. Presented on the page where a Nokia 3310, a 56k modem, a Dot-matrix printer, a Tube TV, and a Speak &amp; Spell. It was a piece about the Museum of Endangered Sounds, a digital archive of sounds we all remember so, so well.</p>
<p>Super geek Brendan Chilcutt (the nom de plume used by the collective who founded the museum), fearfully wonders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when the entire world has adopted devices with sleek, silent touch interfaces, where will we turn for the sound of fingers striking QWERTY keypads? Tell me that. And tell me: Who will play my GameBoy when I&rsquo;m gone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with the website multiple times during the day, and I hope it&rsquo;ll stay live for a long time to come. The quality of the sounds is impeccable, and it really gets you back into that mood of being relaxed, or slightly terrified about something as cute as a pop quiz, or a boyfriend who wouldn&rsquo;t call, or not having that cool phone with a personalized cover. I  I had a box I could fill, keep in the closet and open up whenever things were getting gloomy and I wanted to be close to Grandma Dora, here&rsquo;s what sounds I&rsquo;d put inside it:</p>
<h3 id="the-rotary-dial-telephone">The rotary dial telephone</h3>
<p>It reminds me off the phone my old friend Leonne gave me. It used to belong to her grandmother, but she wanted me to have it. I placed it in my room and felt incredibly proud, because I was the only one I knew who owned such a beautifully old device. What I enjoy remembering is the fact that I hardly ever got a single caller asking for me, because I didn&rsquo;t have my own landline. I spent many hours eavesdropping on my Mom and her friends having boring conversations about nothing important.</p>
<h3 id="the-floppy-disk">The floppy disk</h3>
<p>I remember the time in December of 1999 when Pok√©mon Red and Blue had just come out. Every kid in my school wanted the games, and most of them wanted a Game Boy so they could play them. I already had a Game Boy, I had been addicted to Tetris and Super Mario Land for years. But my mother refused to get me the games. Luckily, my cousin&rsquo;s cousin Ben, a notorious local nerd, had managed to get me two floppy editions for free. I didn&rsquo;t take the disks out very often (I was always playing the games), but I clearly remember that very first time I ever heard a floppy disk up close, when I put in Pok√©mon Red.</p>
<h3 id="tetris">Tetris</h3>
<p>Sitting in the attic, or under my bed, playing the game until my thumbs got sore and I actually had repetitive strain injury. And to this day, if I can get my hands on the game (I&rsquo;ve refused to download the iPad version), I will not say a word for hours.</p>
<h3 id="the-tamagotchi">The Tamagotchi</h3>
<p>This is a sour one for me. Because, while I loved my Tamagotchi in the beginning, I ended up hating its guts. In the late nineties, every single kid in my school had one. I loved taking care of something, the cute sounds it produced and the flashy colour of the case. We were inseperable. But then came 1998, and with it the motherfucking Furby.</p>
<p>Furby was brought on the market right before Christmas (cheeky bastards), and some of my richer friends (five of the six girls in my group, I was the other one) had a Furby. So, my Tamagotchi and I remained friends as the other girls hung out at the park with their furbies, having tea parties in pink sweaters and SHUT UP. I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

    <content>
      <p>My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love to have another life,
just so I could spend it cursing
at everything, and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The negative character of this man is self-evident. He&rsquo;s as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories. It makes hanging out with him a free afternoon at a comedy club. His lifestyle is perfectly suited for his disposition. I&rsquo;m positive his house contains more rooms than even he can count. There is a room for his art, another one for the art his students produce, various studios, six bathrooms, and three separate kitchens. He lives alone where he is boss.</p>
<p>Paul is also much older than I am, think a young grandfather. I expect that his age plays a large part in how comfortable he is low-key hating everybody. I&rsquo;m not so lucky. Whenever I find myself muttering that &ldquo;I hate people&rdquo;, my self-talk quickly turns to shame and guilt. What if mankind is, in fact, nice, and I just happen to not see it? What if all those people on trains producing noises that make me want to explode would happily carry on a conversation with me, if only I was open to some fun?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it would be incredible to have a door in my house, one that only I have the key to. It opens to a world exactly like this, except that nobody there can hear me scream and curse. I would hang out there on occasion, using profanity so profane that Satan would eventually have to come in to please ask me to simmer down because I was offending all the racist, nazi pedophiles in the hottest, darkest corners of hell.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t so much that I am mad at anyone specific, but more so the earth as a whole with everything and everyone on it, including myself. Or maybe I&rsquo;m not even mad, but rather afraid? I mean, that&rsquo;s where anger sometimes comes from, right? Maybe if I take a pillow and shout into it really loudly, and then go back to doing whatever, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120114230620/http://itllbebetter.com/">it&rsquo;ll be better</a>, and I&rsquo;ll be able to get on with my day, working steadily towards artistic retirement in which I smoke excessively at my kitchen table like Paul, worrying about how many lives I need for all my expletives.</p>

      <p>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother&rsquo;s cousins&rsquo; daughters&rsquo; coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a change of strategy, and of pace.</p>
<p>This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on. No more updates on my general well-being, college achievements, and peculiar trains of thought. Sure, there&rsquo;s enough happening, but the focus isn&rsquo;t where it should be: on a white piece of paper. Instead of feeling shame about my lack of commitment, I will simply change the contents.</p>
<p>If I were you, I would adjust my expectations for this particular website: pictures without explanations, cryptic musings, things I like, things I wish to remember, and sometimes the old blog post. Or a combination of all of the above, or something entirely different. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Sorry.
Love you too.</p>

      <p>I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.</p>
<p>Choosing was never my strong suit. I could stand there for hours, by the neatly arranged tables of school supplies. After all, they would have to last me the entire school year. The right supplies, this I figured, would lead to the right achievements. I was so young back then.</p>
<p>Year after year I&rsquo;d find myself biking to town in the Summer months. Cover paper, new pencils, a nice fountain pen, snazzy fineliners. Preferably all the things.</p>
<p>Today, I went to shop for new supplies. I&rsquo;ll be starting my freshman year of university, after a one-year hiatus. I hadn&rsquo;t made a list, I figured a veteran like me could do without it on a trip like this. As soon as I&rsquo;d get to the store, all the requirements would come to me.</p>
<p>The one thing I was keen on finding was a four-subject notebook, one for each course. And after that? Well, that was about it. I did already have a pencil case. And a fountain pen. And pencils. And binders. And a backpack. And a diary.</p>
<p>Home I went, with a teeny tiny plastic bag and two A5 notebooks.</p>
<p>After nine years, I realize I have everything I need. I no longer believe I need certain things to achieve my goals. Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of doing the work, with everything I need just within reach.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>

    <content>
      <p>It&rsquo;s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled &ldquo;DYKES!&rdquo; at us.</p>
<p>I dislike such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia">antics</a> as much as the next gay. I don&rsquo;t like the words &ldquo;dyke&rdquo; and &ldquo;fag&rdquo; and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we&rsquo;re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me. My choice to walk hand in hand with N, and not Nicholas. I rarely encounter homophobia.</p>
<p>But then again, I don&rsquo;t look like a lesbian. It&rsquo;s a personal choice: I&rsquo;m also Dutch, half African, an inhabitant of Eindhoven, married to reading, writing, and books, and in love with Anohni<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> from that band. If I were to express all of those identities, I might as well start wishing I turn into a float tomorrow.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m annoyed with is the fact that yesterday, I saw 300 different stereotyped people pass me in the street, and I somehow managed to keep my mouth shut to all of them. Because I <em>do</em> care about other people&rsquo;s feelings. Because we live IN THE NETHERLANDS, damnit.</p>
<p>But you know, I think about things, and I know the insecure, angry, Moroccan teenager is not to blame. After all, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s had a few insults hurled at him, and he was just reciprocating this civil friendliness. This experience reminds me I don&rsquo;t live in a country that fully accepts the life I live. Whichever way you look at it, emancipation in the gay scene isn&rsquo;t as omnipresent as we think it is.</p>
<p>Because today is the Day of Days, and some people are on their tenth sangria dancing on a boat in thong underwear, I think it&rsquo;s only fitting to think about what a multicultural and diverse country such as the Netherlands is really doing.</p>
<p>Are gay people more emancipated than the San Francisco of the 70s? Or do the near-naked protests, gay gyms, gay saunas, gay stores, gay parties, gay travel agencies find ways to work against us? Is the gap between straight people and gay people bigger than we care to admit? Are we still asking whether &ldquo;we&rdquo; fit into &ldquo;your&rdquo; world and vice versa, or is there finally space to start talking about &ldquo;our&rdquo; world?</p>
<p>If &ldquo;we&rdquo; want to fit into &ldquo;your&rdquo; world ‚Äî which I think we&rsquo;ve already been doing for decades, just to the inattentiveness of some ‚Äî is it smart of gay people to seclude ourselves to spaces designed for people like us? When one lesbian says &ldquo;hey dyke&rdquo; to another, it&rsquo;s a term of endearment. But if a straight girl or, even better, a Moroccan boy, says the term casually near a gay person, we call it discrimination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for emancipation, and against exception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sitting here writing this instead of celebrating Gay Pride.</p>
<p>What do you think? I know it&rsquo;s a difficult subject, but please keep it civil in the comments. Constructive criticism, please.</p>

      <p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve is sweet. I spent the morning at Coffee Company Oosterdok working on my website. The girl barista and the guy who came to take over her shift are apparently dating. He&rsquo;s got a full mullet and a geeky mustache. It&rsquo;s that season of fashion again. He was the type of soft masculine only Gen Z-ers can be. At 36, I seem to be developing a habit of noticing how much I&rsquo;m no longer an 18-year-old. Everyone who seems my age addresses me with the formal &ldquo;u&rdquo;. I also saw S in the street. It&rsquo;s the first anniversary of her father&rsquo;s passing and she was wondering out loud what could properly trigger an ugly cry. She offered me a red velvet &ldquo;oliebol&rdquo;, which looked like a fried dog treat. No thank you, ma&rsquo;am. A friendly face in the neighborhood knocks on our window and tells me she has enjoyed getting to know us a little more, and that she hopes to be in touch more in 2024. 6pm and pizzas enter the oven. It took only 15 minutes for us to finally get into <em>Better Call Saul</em>. I expect I won&rsquo;t even make it until midnight. Happy New Year!</p>

      <p>I edit my biography in a community app for Black professionals. Other people use the flags of their heritage, and I decide to do the same. Which one goes first, üá≥üá± or üá∏üáπ? I was born in the Netherlands, and consider myself not Dutch per se but definitely an Amsterdammer. Truth be told, I&rsquo;ve never been to S√£o Tom√© and Principe, and the parent who hails from there left when he was ten. I wonder, brushing my teeth before bedtime, whether it&rsquo;s appropriation for me to use the flag. And then I think of all the brown and Black faces I know, doing just the same, and entirely dignified and correct in doing what they do. It&rsquo;s one of the prices of growing up Black in a white environment: I wonder when I&rsquo;ll stop feeling like <em>I&rsquo;m</em> the racist.</p>

      <p>My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it&rsquo;s like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He&rsquo;s the person who was so discombobulated by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26029077">Dutch white innocence</a>, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He&rsquo;s doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive. He even joined a theatre group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember when you scolded me because my website was in Times New Roman?&rdquo; I ask him. He doesn&rsquo;t. Back when this happened, he was working a Dutch corporate job. Part of him, or perhaps all of him, must have been so embarrassed to learn he&rsquo;d sent his UX-hopeful coworker to a webpage that looked like it never left the late nineties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh look, another book on personal branding&rdquo; I say as we walk into American Book Center. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually really what I need&rdquo; he says. It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s hoping to be invited to SoHo House Amsterdam. &ldquo;That reminds me of, what&rsquo;s her name&hellip; Anna Delvey?&rdquo; I say. That&rsquo;s exactly what it is, he tells me. It&rsquo;s a private place for selected Amsterdam creatives. A country club in the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great. You can&rsquo;t take pictures in there, they let you connect with other creatives, and it&rsquo;s 200 euros a month. My friend rebranded herself in such a brilliant way, check out this picture of her with her paintings on Instagram. She got an invite right away.&rdquo; When I note that he moved a five-hour plane ride away from SoHo House Spuistraat, he seems surprised.</p>
<p>At Coffee Company, he shows me his blog, but he holds his hand over the title, of which I manage to catch a glimpse. It&rsquo;s such a weird name I forget it instantly, but the writing is beautiful. I&rsquo;m saddened by Gen Z&rsquo;s inability to just use their own bleeding name for stuff. I don&rsquo;t think the fragmentation is doing them any good.</p>
<p>I peer pressure him into getting one of those silly hand treatments at Lush, where the people always seem a little too eager to greet you. The person giving the treatment has a pronoun button on their apron, but still I get it wrong. &ldquo;Zinzy, her pronouns are they/them&rdquo; my friend says. Minutes later, I joke how I need an applause for managing to use the correct pronoun. The two most oppressed people on Kalverstraat, and we&rsquo;re mere inches away from becoming the boomers we avoid.</p>
<p>We finally land at Bar Bario, where the Callaloo Hoek staff has come down with covid. What a waste of a good appetite, I think, as I Uber us Ranchi sandwiches. Like two people on a date that can&rsquo;t find its pace, we take turns asking each other questions from the jar on the table. &ldquo;When was the first time you felt represented by the media?&rdquo; I ask him. &ldquo;Never&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> is your SoHo House,&rdquo; I say, waving my arms feverishly at the Black pride on the walls and queer people of color at the bar. &ldquo;<em>Your</em> people are <em>here</em>&rdquo;. He cries a little bit, but because he can&rsquo;t escape the characteristics of his generation, I can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s faking it, method acting, or just unable to cry like a normal person.</p>

      <p>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could&rsquo;ve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say &ldquo;adult&rdquo; but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.</p>
