      <p>I&rsquo;ve long admired the ways in which German culture had learnt to grapple with WW2. It instilled me with hope that humans can learn from their mistakes, and that looking at a problem is more effective than looking away from it. Your post vibrates in the same frequency.</p>

      <p>Thanks for providing a quick summary of Cal&rsquo;s video. Saved me a watch. At first glance, his idea resonates immediately, particularly the concept of the infinite buffer. I suppose it&rsquo;s not difficult to get lost trying to distinguish this buffer from the cybernetic tools we use to populate it.</p>

      <ul>
<li>This week marked the week I got back into the swing of things at work. I tend to find the holiday season quite boring because things slow down quite a bit. Now that people are returning from their winter break, my to do list is filling up again with exciting projects, opportunities for collaboration, and research endeavors. As usual, a conversation with my manager reminded me how much I love my job.</li>
<li>I finished Angela Davis&rsquo; <em>[[Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (2015)|Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (2015)]]</em> and read a few chapters of <em>[[Out There Screaming: An Anthology of New Black Horror (2023)|Out There Screaming: An Anthology of New Black Horror (2023)]]</em>. I had forgotten how much I love gothic horror. Echoes of Carmen Maria Machado&rsquo;s <em>[[Her Body and Other Parties (2017)|Her Body and Other Parties (2017)]]</em> were in my head as a result all week.</li>
<li>I also began reading [[Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)|Saving Jesus From the Church (2009)]] again after first picking it up last Summer. It&rsquo;s a special book, one I&rsquo;ll return to again and again I&rsquo;m sure.</li>
<li>In 2023, my Wednesdays at the office varied from busy to overwhelming: lots of interactions, many meetings, few moments to myself. By the time Bible study came around at 6:30, I was ready for bed. The Wednesday this week was radically different: I had very few meetings, got to concentrate on my task list, and I attended my first [[Omek|Omek]] accountability circle event. I found Omek, a community for people from the African diaspora, in the Autumn of 2023, and immediately considered it too good to be true. I found out this week that it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s actually a community of Black people from all over the world, all professionals at various stages in their career, and many of them live in Amsterdam. The accountability circle had me eat a desk lunch. <em>and</em> check off a large portion of what I had been looking to accomplish during the entire week. Awesome.</li>
<li>Our dear friend AR from Stockholm came to stay at our place because she was attended a weekend-long dance workshop in Amsterdam. Five minutes with her and I remember there&rsquo;s an entire portion of myself that I don&rsquo;t tap into enough. Our conversations flow flawlessly, as if the last time we spoke wasn&rsquo;t three years ago. I appreciate the depth we so easily reach, the air that I feel around myself, my relationships, my choices. We spend three evenings over candlelight, talking about work, family, love, trust, faith, Judaism, the war, and so much more.</li>
<li>Another great thing about Wednesday was that I had the energy to attend Bible study, which started out small with the usual suspects, and became something different altogether when two other queer people of color showed up. They didn&rsquo;t even realize there was only one straight person at the table until later. It was a very sweet experience to hear about their journeys. I hope I&rsquo;ll see them again. We talked about the part in John when 
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John&#43;1%3A42-51&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesus calls Philip and Nathanael</a> and it made me think about feeling seen, wholly.</li>
<li>On Saturday, I had the good fortune of meeting NB, a person I met at Omek. Over chicken and waffles we got to meet each other and it felt like we were old friends. It&rsquo;s <em>spectacular</em> to hear about the experiences of a Black person who grew up in a white environment.</li>
<li>Nice IndieWeb discovery this week:

      <ul>
<li>A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee.</li>
<li>I seem to have found my way back to the [[Miracle morning|Miracle morning]] method. While I cringe at the very notion of self development, it has been great to start my day in quietude.</li>
<li>Lemonade did really well on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and while I think she would&rsquo;ve been fine sleeping in her crate in the loving room, we let her sleep on the bed. We&rsquo;re now people whose dog sleeps on their bed. Another benefit to this, besides cuddles, is that it gives me the living room to wake up calmly.</li>
<li>I spent my winter break walking serious distances in the city, and now that I&rsquo;m back to work the rush of my calendar (even when it was mostly empty this week) made it so that I didn&rsquo;t really go on a single urban hike.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been making a bigger effort to practice the [[Law of two feet|Law of two feet]], and much to my amusement it gives me so much more headspace.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re continuing our <em>[[Better Call Saul (2015-2022)|Better Call Saul (2015-2022)]]</em> journey, which, mid-way through season 2, seems to find itself in a bit of a legal lull. I wonder if it&rsquo;ll change. I wonder if I&rsquo;ll continue watching if it doesn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve set a reading challenge on Goodreads this year, and this week I&rsquo;m already down 1, 25 more to go. I&rsquo;ve discovered that non-fiction audio books work well for me.</li>
<li>On Friday, we had farewell drinks for AN. I&rsquo;m quite sad to see him go. He and I both have golden retriever energy, and it was always a bit of a homecoming to be at the office with him.</li>
<li>On Saturday, I went to Coppenhagen for new beads. I&rsquo;ve been looking for excuses to make more rosaries, and I decided I&rsquo;ll make one for each liturgical color.</li>

      <p>Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think</em>, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, and <em>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</em> are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, 
<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-design-books-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://start.uxdesign.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guide to Design</a> by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point</li>
<li>Career Foundry has a nice overview of 
<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-become-a-ux-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to become a UX designer</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UX Matters</a> is perhaps my favorite resource on UX topics</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UX Research Field Guide</a> by UserInterviews.com. It focuses purely on research practice, but it&rsquo;s a comprehensive overview of all things involved in focusing on the U in UX.</li>
