      <description>Good&#xA;Bad&#xA;Who I saw&#xA;Consumed&#xA;A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&amp;rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee.&#xA;I seem to have found my way back to the [[Miracle morning|Miracle morning]] method. While I cringe at the very notion of self development, it has been great to start my day in quietude.</description>

      <description>Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t Make Me Think, The Design of Everyday Things, and 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books. The Guide to Design by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point Career Foundry has a nice overview of How to become a UX designer UX Matters is perhaps my favorite resource on UX topics UX Research Field Guide by UserInterviews.</description>

      <description> Updated the general UI of this website by adding a softer background color Added a splice method I used earlier to photo posts, which allows me to alter the size of the images served through Cloudinary Merged _notes contents into my _posts folder so that my dated content is organized in a single place (this is convenient for pagination purposes) Styled the tags page Updated layout of an individual tag page so that short notes and posts are grouped accordingly </description>

      <description>Knowing I&amp;rsquo;m at home in Amsterdam is getting on the tram, seeing the same conductor as a few hours ago, spotting various people whose faces I know. A city as a village, but in a non-insular way.</description>

      <description>Covid It&amp;rsquo;s curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. Despite a negative test, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I&amp;rsquo;m not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I&amp;rsquo;ve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week? I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing.</description>

      <description>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted &amp;ldquo;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&amp;rdquo;. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.&#xA;I was there for four reasons:&#xA;My definition of God is &amp;ldquo;science is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her&amp;rdquo; I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event The Dutch carnival season had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman.</description>

      <description>I delivered this sermon today at All Saints Amsterdam.&#xA;A few months ago, along with much of humanity, it seemed, I went to see Barbie. Walking out of the theatre and forming an opinion on this intro to feminism, I renamed the film to a title which I will use again today: &amp;ldquo;Blueprints: a pamphlet against simplicity&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see all of your faces here today. I&amp;rsquo;ve met most of you before, but let me make an official introduction.</description>

      <description>First of all: not a great week. I continue to struggle to notice when I feel stresed or overwhelmed, and it never fails to result in my body giving me a clear sign. On Monday evening, in the midst of a busy work month, my body said &amp;ldquo;SIT. DOWN.&amp;rdquo; I needed undtil well into the weekend to feel myself again. One of the signs my body knows to give it a very mild version of conversion disorder: I lose the ability to listen to a conversation while I walk without feeling very dizzy.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I attended the very first gathering of FC de Filmfanaten, a brand-new film club that my friend Jolien started. There were four of us, and we discussed the movie I was proud to have suggested: Talk To Me. I love speaking about films with others, and particularly with this diverse group of people. Everyone brought a completely unique perspective to the film, one brought film industry insights while the other had thoughtful ideas that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered.</description>

      <description>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this the sky is gray and it&amp;rsquo;s raining, but this week&amp;rsquo;s weather was cheerful and moderate. On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required.</description>

      <description>IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can&amp;rsquo;t keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler. There&amp;rsquo;s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad.</description>

      <description>I usually take a while to overcome the cringe I feel about my past selves, but why wait when I can laugh joyfully right now at Anja and myself less than a month ago, passing the Swedish city of Göteborg and thinking the printing press was invented there?</description>

      <description>I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</description>

      <description>Met [[Tim Bleeker|Tim Bleeker]] at [[Somerlust Park|Somerlust Park]] on [[2023-08-22|Tuesday]], a get-together that started as &amp;ldquo;chilling in the park&amp;rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&amp;rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&amp;rsquo; requests.</description>

There are three major changes:&#xA;Status update at the top of the page Content is now served through a submodule Blogroll I love Mu-An&amp;rsquo;s status update so much I had to have it for myself. I like the idea of fleeting messages, blurbs shouted into space, with no proper archive. I almost fool myself into thinking nobody will be able to hold me accountable for what I publish there, but we all know that&amp;rsquo;s not true.</description>

      <description>All the teachers around me are slowly getting nervous anticipating the start of the new school year. Anja&amp;rsquo;s taking her anger out on the pottery wheel. I can smell the freshly-sharpened pencils from here. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just the August rain, wrinkling the foreheads of sun lovers, creating warm puddles on the pavement, telling us it went by in a blink.</description>

      <description>The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I&amp;rsquo;m just landing. No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam isn’t using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be.</description>

      <description>After two weeks in Scandinavia, it&amp;rsquo;s clear: we are both too Dutch for proper recycling. Secretly hoarding our trash to avoid a reprimanding from our AirBnb host as he hovers over his six-compartment recycling bin, we continue our trip from rural Sweden to Copenhagen looking for a public recycling station.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Imagine if we got so nervous about doing it wrong that we ended up just dumping these bags by the roadside&amp;rdquo; I say to Anja.</description>

      <description>I am notorious for never grasping how many people know how much about what. To save myself from any further embarrassment I won&amp;rsquo;t spend my time here telling you what the app is about. The team does that nicely over here. I do think I have something to say about what Scriptogr.am came exactly at the right time for me.&#xA;As we more further down the line of Web 2.0 and slowly into the abyss that is Web 3.</description>

      <description>Nienke, Mehdi, an anonymous friend, and I attend the annual Pride March. It&amp;rsquo;s the city&amp;rsquo;s first two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term &amp;ldquo;queer&amp;rdquo;, I am pleased Queer Amsterdam is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.&#xA;On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &amp;ldquo;an anonymous friend&amp;rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</description>

      <description>Just spotted a family of tourists, the dad one of those Pabst Blue Ribbon hipsters who’s now adulting. He wore a shirt that read “THE SMITHS”, accompanied by a black-and-white group photo of Will Smith with his wife and kids. Thought it was deeply hilarious.</description>

      <description>Hey Desi love, hope you&amp;rsquo;re well! As promised, here&amp;rsquo;s that overview of handy UX things:&#xA;You should sign up for ADPList, a platform that offers free one-on-one mentoring with all kinds of folks. They have handy filters in place to help you identify the questions you have, and how you can best answer them with a mentor. Some thought leaders that I love: NN Group, UX Matters, Stéphanie Walter (specialized in enterprise products like me), UX Collective, and UX Planet.</description>

      <description>At the end of the shopping street&#xA;for people who look like&#xA;they do in the magazines&#xA;there’s a blonde marching in place waiting&#xA;for the light to turn green.&#xA;She is not running per se, rather&#xA;she’s hinting at running.&#xA;Selling it, the way&#xA;Charlize Theron sells&#xA;a night to remember in a perfume commercial&#xA;with next to nothing for evidence.&#xA;Me, a tired mother,&#xA;and a tennis player with wet hair</description>

      <description>Finally we have them over to the house again, for the first time in what feels like a human life. One walks in smiling, the other bursts out in tears. “She’s pregnant” I think to myself. I’m right. For whatever godforsaken reason I see her as a submarine now. We talk without pausing, picking up from what could have been yesterday.</description>

      <description>This week, I attended my first Gerimedica party. It’s great to know I can expect a big celebration every year, and not just for the company’s sweet sixteen. It confirmed what I already know: great vibe, great taste, great people. I went to Bar Bario on Saturday for a meet-up called Hair Haven, which fosters connection between people with curly hair. Again, I was struck by how welcoming the space is.</description>

      <description>Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):&#xA;PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian You may want to download their Windows app If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes I think you may enjoy this article on PKM for researchers </description>

      <description>It feels cliché to phrase it like this, but I feel I witnessed a historic Keti Koti ceremony today, with a surprisingly genuine request for forgiveness by our king. It was a good year for me to finally understand my place in a holiday that’s part mine and part not. The ceremony made up for the hour-long wait in the half rain to get a sandwich for someone who had already gone home.</description>

      <description>Two months of onboarding have rushed by in a blink. The new job is absolutely wonderful: the people are great, the work is complex and important, and the office itself is perhaps the finest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked at. I joined this company because the challenges they have seemed interesting to me. I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that, two months in, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to think that, at one point in time, these challenges weren&amp;rsquo;t also mine.</description>

      <description>Hey Elliott, so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on June 23rd, here&amp;rsquo;s some stuff I love:&#xA;Jason Cosper inspired me to get rid of my About page.</description>

      <description>Hey John and Maarten, thanks for meeting me for coffee! I loved nerding out with you two about IndieWeb stuff, personal sites, the red ThinkPad belly button, and what personal web projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on. As promised, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of things I wanted to share with you:&#xA;A few IndieWeb people I like (who are involved in the community in various degrees) are Simone Silverstroni, Manuel Moreale, Mu-An Chiou, Derek Kedziora, and Elliott Cost, the latter two of whom live in Amsterdam as well.</description>

      <description>I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. I check the news multiple times a day. I scoff at outlets that don&amp;rsquo;t deem it worthy of the front page. I also scoff at outlets that do. A media drama can antagonize me the way Adele disappoints me with her popularity.&#xA;The fact that I’m part of a Titanic/Titanic-obsessed gaggle of netizens somehow has me convinced I&amp;rsquo;m not just procrastinating.</description>

      <description>While walking to grab coffee, my colleague tells me about the peculiarities of his seventeenth-century hat making ancestors, proud of the genealogical research his dad has done. After work, I google “Trans-Atlantic slave trade”, looking to see if I can spot my father’s generic colonist surname among those who made it back to his island. I can’t, of course.</description>

      <description>Past midnight, I look for me in the yellow shirt on a Paris high street, next to you and I think I’m crying a bit. Mid-steak I jumped up from my chair, shouted your moniker at the top of my lungs, and we talked about the Internet, mental health, about women writing, about Paris, and how beautiful and odd it was that I knew so much about two kids I would never meet.</description>

      <description>Reading a book on Bijlmer Bajes (a famous Amsterdam prison), and I’m chuckling at the architect’s decision not to add bars to the windows, but instead rely on “wire alarm” in the glass. Obviously it resulted in a lot of prison breaks, but what fascinates me is that the user story changed completely from a prison guard aiming to keep a prisoner from breaking out to them aiming to be alerted to a breakout attempt.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week I found myself in line at a coffee place giving my friend a very passionate speech in response to her question &amp;ldquo;why would anyone have a website?&amp;rdquo;. I always marvel at people who don&amp;rsquo;t share this sentiment with us, James. Nice to meet you!</description>

      <description>Every time I embark on a journey towards a published post about why it&amp;rsquo;s good to have a website, I get lost in the reality of personal details. Everyone has different reasons for believing something. Aiming to take them all into account doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me write anything that feels worthwhile and not like a derivative1.&#xA;It feels much more relevant to focus my attention on specific people. In this case I&amp;rsquo;m focusing my attention on you, Nienke.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late in the morning and I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to Gerimedica, the company&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. I&amp;rsquo;m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.1 The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.&#xA;The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of calling my office.</description>

      <description>Enjoying Sunday night dinner with Anja and my father-in-law. As of recent, we’ve been experimenting with taking it down a notch, food-wise. Rather than wowing guests with eight hours of cooking time, we now feel much more comfortable cooking a few dishing and ordering stuff we love. Today, our Middle Eastern menu was complemented by dishes from D&amp;amp;A.</description>

      <description>One skill I’m pleased to have been cultivating these past few years is giving myself a permission slip to rest. I just woke up from a two-hour nap and boy, the world is a new place. Anja clearly remembers the dragon I would turn into whenever I was in need of a nap or just waking up from one. As though I would need to punish myself for having taking a break.</description>

      <description>Spring is here, I think? I spend the afternoon in the park with ex-colleague-turned-friend Susan, who is celebrating landing a new and challenging job. There&amp;rsquo;s a boy in the park who&amp;rsquo;s walking around barefoot. Later we see him on a slack line. I like this scene; it tells me that summer is almost upon us.&#xA;I never seem skilled at enjoying whatever season is here. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m forever yearning for what&amp;rsquo;s just out of reach.</description>

      <description>Today, Lemonade and I visited Studio Pansa Amstel, where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that&amp;rsquo;s so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is &amp;ldquo;dirty hands, clear mind&amp;rdquo;, and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.&#xA;I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker&amp;rsquo;s mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands.</description>

      <description>What I love most about today&amp;rsquo;s snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.</description>

      <description>Life sure is different now that we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten Lemonade on a proper walking schedule. She still feels most comfortable going potty on the puppy pads we have on our balcony, but she absolutely loves going out and exploring the neighborhood.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how well she walks on a loose leash, and how few issues we&amp;rsquo;ve had with the stuff she puts in her mouth. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make most use of her imprint period, and that means familiarizing her with as many different things as possible.</description>

      <description>When I first set foot in the Old Catholic Church to attend an All Saints service, I knew I had found a special place. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.&#xA;It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other 23 years, and, by miracle, our friendship is both acclimatized to our adult lives and as full of energy and curiosity as it was when we met in our first year of secondary school.&#xA;She comes bearing gifts: seeds for the garden, dyke poetry, David Sedaris.</description>

He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.&#xA;We exchange how life is treating us, what we&amp;rsquo;re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing.</description>

      <description>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: Patrick Rhone and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough to catch the planning stage on his blog right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at Cafe de Tuin, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing &amp;ldquo;raise a glass to freedom&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken in eight years.&#xA;I had emailed him late last year, missing our kitchen table conversations over coffee and cigarettes. His enormous house, a former school, functioning as his private art studio / gallery. He had replied right away, saying &amp;ldquo;my phone number is still the same&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year. After two weeks of cocooning, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block.</description>

      <description>Playing the piano is helping me put some puzzle pieces in the right place. I’ve always had the ability to reproduce the pitch of a song, but it wasn’t until I began playing the piano that I now seem able to identify the key by name. It may seem silly or small, but that’s a game-changer for me. It makes me feel that I can put everything together now; as though I’ve come full circle.</description>

      <description>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A godmother was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.&#xA;The ROI of good research Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation.</description>

      <description>I love this essay, Simone. Fully embracing the very IndieWeb concept of a personal website has helped me shake this feeling of FOMO, I imagine the same way it did for you. Don&amp;rsquo;t be hard on yourself, though, we all fell for this concept, and many of us still do. If society presents something as a way to solve a problem, most people will eventually try it. And while it does solve some problems, it also creates others.</description>

      <description>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how new the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it&amp;rsquo;s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.&#xA;You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but fangirl.</description>

      <description>Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.&#xA;I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20.</description>

      <description>If you still needed convincing that I&amp;rsquo;m Grandma Tech at home, struggling to use even the most straightforward of functionalities, please be aware that I was today years old when I learned that, five years ago, TextExpander released a custom iOS keyboard that would&amp;rsquo;ve solved so many of my mundane problems, and all I was doing was asking myself &amp;ldquo;why am I even paying for that app anymore?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Listening to act two of This American Life&amp;rsquo;s episode The Runaround, in which we meet a boy who can only really calm his mind by running loops around the block, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder: it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful to see a young problem-solver with ADHD make life easier for himself, but were there other people who thought of the compensatory behaviors often displayed by people with an eating disorder?</description>

      <description>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We&amp;rsquo;ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so &amp;ldquo;dress for cold, hope for warmth&amp;rdquo; I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</description>

      <description>January flew, flew by, I tell you. We started with &amp;ldquo;wow, 2023 already, let&amp;rsquo;s have a chill time this year, hey what&amp;rsquo;s on Netflix?&amp;rdquo; and at the time of writing everything is different:&#xA;Things are not chill, because we&amp;rsquo;re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy We cancelled Netflix I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for years that I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a woman who runs a bookshop in De Bijlmer. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I&amp;rsquo;m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She&amp;rsquo;s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.&#xA;Aside from bookshop owner she&amp;rsquo;s also a writer. I love the work she does at One World, where she articulates strong perspectives on antiracism and equity.</description>

      <description>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.&#xA;The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season.</description>

      <description>We had two friends over today. They’re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we’d one day get together and watch Love Actually, much-beloved by each of us.&#xA;I’ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships.</description>

      <description>On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don’t know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.&#xA;I’m learning it’s not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan.</description>

      <description>I’m in that supremely annoying stage of prospective dog ownership where I casually interrogate dog owners at parties, curious about their pet’s behavior and the techniques employed, and then silently judge them for their mistakes, exchanging contemptuous glances with Anja in the process.</description>

      <description>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, This American Life, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself &amp;ldquo;argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!&amp;rdquo; Today is one of those days. I&amp;rsquo;m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed by the rediscovery of life&amp;rsquo;s unsteadiness. At the same time, there&amp;rsquo;s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I&amp;rsquo;ve been so anxious that bad news wasn&amp;rsquo;t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</description>

      <description>In a few days, I&amp;rsquo;ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.&#xA;One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there&amp;rsquo;s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I&amp;rsquo;m capable), but I could tell something had been missing.</description>

      <description>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of alt text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to regard alt text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</description>

      <description>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we&amp;rsquo;ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We&amp;rsquo;re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I&amp;rsquo;m crying.&#xA;2022 showed me that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality.</description>

      <description>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s latest film The Whale, one writer concluded that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don&amp;rsquo;t: judge the film before I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it.</description>

      <description>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at Triangle of Sadness and White Noise. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I&amp;rsquo;d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you&amp;rsquo;ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</description>

      <description>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate! Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said &amp;ldquo;where are the tea lights?&amp;rdquo;, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</description>

      <description>I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long. I mimic my late stepfather, who used to wimper like a puppy whenever he got a cold. I still do well to limit my hours of screen time.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally don&amp;rsquo;t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to document what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.&#xA;Tools Jekyll: as is often the case for me, this site is built using my favorite flat-file content management system Github: hosts the code for this website Netlify: serves the content to my website Obsidian: I write in a single Obsidian vault obsidian-git: helps me manage the version control of my Obsidian content Push git subdirectory as branch: a Github action that lets me publish a part of the content of my Obsidian vault to a separate repository Git submodule: my separate repository is pulled into my website&amp;rsquo;s code base Netlify build hook: every day, Netlify looks for new content and publishes it to my website Why this is great I hold the strong belief that tools don&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

      <description>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work for me, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.&#xA;I finished reading The Midnight Library, which I had borrowed from Annelie.</description>

      <description>Each year I&amp;rsquo;m less embarrassed to say it: I don&amp;rsquo;t like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there&amp;rsquo;s King&amp;rsquo;s Day and Liberation Day, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it really messes with my head. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.</description>

      <description>Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.&#xA;I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know everything about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak.</description>

      <description>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble understanding whether I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I&amp;rsquo;ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.&#xA;At work Leeruniek&amp;rsquo;s Product team is hiring, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been the one taking care of the recruitment process for two engineering and one design role.</description>

      <description>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you &amp;ldquo;leave it cleaner than you found it&amp;rdquo; and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re gone after two days. At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury.</description>

      <description>I never get much reading done unless I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I&amp;rsquo;m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.&#xA;Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side.</description>

      <description>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.&#xA;I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone.</description>

      <description>This was written as part of Vine &amp;amp; Fig&amp;rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.&#xA;When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.&#xA;Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp;amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter.</description>

      <description>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. Jeopardy makes everything better.&#xA;I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at Simon Meijssen. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they&amp;rsquo;re too bready.</description>

      <description>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I&amp;rsquo;m a part, a White lesbian asked me: &amp;ldquo;when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like me join?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great questions,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;my response is identical to what you would say if someone went &amp;lsquo;why do you need lesbian bars? You don&amp;rsquo;t see me going to a straight bar, do you?</description>

      <description>The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I&amp;rsquo;m at Basquiat waiting to catch up with a friend, and an Irish woman strikes up a conversation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can&amp;rsquo;t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, completing our visit with Anneli and Milan, I said calmly to Anja:&#xA;I think I may try not drinking for a week or so.&#xA;Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter.</description>

      <description>I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I&amp;rsquo;ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it through two seasons of Love After Lockup and six seasons of Sister Wives. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention.</description>

      <description>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always able to execute on them.&#xA;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:</description>

      <description>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren&amp;rsquo;t assigned at birth.&#xA;As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns.</description>

      <description>When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.&#xA;For the past five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates.</description>

We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Work is so great!&amp;rdquo; I think to myself on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Below is a list of thoughts, opinions, ideas, and tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered in my 33rd year on Earth.&#xA;Working from home does wonders for my productivity and mental health I like the term &amp;ldquo;Torah-observant Catholic&amp;rdquo; for me Shaving my head has been one of the finest decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made in life. I wish I could just answer &amp;lsquo;Wit Huiswerk&amp;rsquo; to most Dutch statements I hear about racism Got my first tattoo in June I listened to &amp;lsquo;Girls&amp;rsquo; by girl in red 208 times this year 🤦🏽 We got COVID-19 and it was terrifying, even without a hospital stay It&amp;rsquo;s very liberating to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about that&amp;rdquo; when people ask small talk questions about my family or past This bolognese sauce from Smitten Kitch produces the best lasagna I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had I found a new job at a company that does great things for the world My favorite part of the pandemic, after Tiger King, was Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign team sending out a newsletter every 40 minutes on Election day It&amp;rsquo;s okay This acoustic version of Mama Kin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Rescue me&amp;rsquo; is so nice I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to speak with a Jewish family member who has become convinced that there is a satanic cabal injecting corona through 5G I will not forget the empty shelves Got my second tattoo in December I missed Paris in 2020 This pen is this year&amp;rsquo;s favorite My father died I bleached my hair I joined the leadership team of Vine &amp;amp; Fig and it is so very baller Ate Fluff for the first time My man Kit built and opened a restaurant I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch Killing Eve until now I&amp;rsquo;ve begun drinking decaffeinated coffee.</description>

      <description>When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”&#xA;When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp;amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people&amp;rsquo;s bodies.</description>

      <description>After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Airtrade. This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we&amp;rsquo;ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What&amp;rsquo;s more, five years is a good run, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&#xA;My next adventure is taking me even deeper into making tools for people at work, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more thrilled.</description>

      <description>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:&#xA;Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — America Magazine&#xA;My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn&amp;rsquo;t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions.</description>

I am the second.&#xA;Working in travel technology, my experience of the outbreak of Covid 19 was colored by coworkers wondering by the water cooler what all the fuss was about.</description>

A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.&#xA;As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again.</description>

      <description>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the Women&amp;rsquo;s March. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t often attend protests, not in the last place because I&amp;rsquo;m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can&amp;rsquo;t be very positive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard someone compare it to the relationship between a parent and a child. I imagine a child wanting to create a birthday card for his mother, opting to draw her portrait on the cover. Does that child draw a lifelike portrait of his mother? No, but it sure is endearing. I just want to draw the most beautiful portrait I can with the colors I got from my Mother.</description>

      <description>Christmas break is passing by me like it passes by an ambitious teenager. I greeted all the things I could do with great enthusiasm. Sadly, that feeling quickly turned into terror once I realised two weeks isn’t that long and I need to sleep.&#xA;Productivity-wise, man can only fail under such conditions, this I know.&#xA;Meanwhile, I keep being amazed by the weather in Haarlem. I managed to take some photos downtown last week that remind me of the beginning of September, despite a winter coat here and rain hat there.</description>

      <description>If you ever happen to find yourself in the sleepy fishing town of IJmuiden: the fish, service, atmosphere, and cheesecake in the fish restaurant De Meerplaats are all very pleasant. For my birthday, Erica Bouma gave me Jesus by rebel theologian Hans Küng. It’s a great and easy read — a recommendation for anybody interested in the history of Christianity. The Son and the Stranger is a beautiful Dutch-language documentary about Daan, a man who, after studying Hebrew in university, converted to the ultra orthodox Jewish faith.</description>

      <description>Ryan Holiday describes the how and why of his ‘Commonplace Book’, a collection of quotes and other pieces of text written down on index cards. I, too, have been keeping such a system since I started college. I always carry a few cards when I’m out and about, held together by bulldog clips.&#xA;Incredibly handy and simple, it has turned out.</description>

      <description>Remember those times when you were at the store, and as your mother went about her shopping, you were attracting attention to your little self by doing something foolish, bringing soft smiles to all the surrounding adults, except for this one asshole? I have a growing suspicion that I am that person.</description>

      <description>This is a list of things I truly have no opinion on. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I have a negative opinion and I&amp;rsquo;m just sugarcoating it by saying I don&amp;rsquo;t have one. These are things of which, when I think about them, I am baffled to know they don&amp;rsquo;t trigger any form of criticism or evaluation.&#xA;Goldfish Superman Enya The Shawshank Redemption Christians The Alpes Game of Thrones Gangnam Hard towels Drug trafficking Tacos Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s Disney World </description>

      <description>The only journal I’ve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, as I swiped through my digital September issue of Wired, I came across a bit that immediately swung me back right into my first year of high school. Presented on the page where a Nokia 3310, a 56k modem, a Dot-matrix printer, a Tube TV, and a Speak &amp;amp; Spell. It was a piece about the Museum of Endangered Sounds, a digital archive of sounds we all remember so, so well.</description>

      <description>My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:&#xA;I would love to have another life, just so I could spend it cursing at everything, and everyone.&#xA;The negative character of this man is self-evident. He&amp;rsquo;s as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories.</description>

      <description>What is the deal with people and coffee? No, let&amp;rsquo;s try that again. What is the deal with people and dish water? Coffee1 these days. Is. Disgusting.&#xA;A Starbucks recently opened in Utrecht, and to celebrate the occassion, a dear friend of mine, whom I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in two years, suggested we meet there for a pumpkin spiced whatever.&#xA;Pat, I&amp;rsquo;d love to buy a middle finger. Or else perhaps just a question mark.</description>

      <description>I can remember what was taught in my Applied Linguistics class by the shirt my professor wore. My biggest secret is an unending fascination for the Momversation in which mommy bloggers discuss motherhood. Some people in my Dutch Language and Culture program are bad at spelling. All of them want to be writers. Times a day I realize I probably don&amp;rsquo;t want kids: 17. I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of failing University. During the day I&amp;rsquo;m scared, and when I&amp;rsquo;m not scared, I&amp;rsquo;m asleep.</description>

      <description>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother&amp;rsquo;s cousins&amp;rsquo; daughters&amp;rsquo; coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.&#xA;So here&amp;rsquo;s a change of strategy, and of pace.&#xA;This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on.</description>

      <description>I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.&#xA;Choosing was never my strong suit.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled &amp;ldquo;DYKES!&amp;rdquo; at us.&#xA;I dislike such antics as much as the next gay. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the words &amp;ldquo;dyke&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fag&amp;rdquo; and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we&amp;rsquo;re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me.</description>

      <description>I’m now writing these notes using an Apple Shortcut (as inspired by Mu-An. It’s a great way to publish IndieWeb content without having to do any special magic. Setting up this posting strategy has helped me evaluate how I handle notes on this website. My writing often contains short, daily reflections, but it may be worthwhile to move that to this section. Then I can reserve the writing area for longer-form content.</description>

      <description>New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve is sweet. I spent the morning at Coffee Company Oosterdok working on my website. The girl barista and the guy who came to take over her shift are apparently dating. He&amp;rsquo;s got a full mullet and a geeky mustache. It&amp;rsquo;s that season of fashion again. He was the type of soft masculine only Gen Z-ers can be. At 36, I seem to be developing a habit of noticing how much I&amp;rsquo;m no longer an 18-year-old.</description>

      <description>I edit my biography in a community app for Black professionals. Other people use the flags of their heritage, and I decide to do the same. Which one goes first, 🇳🇱 or 🇸🇹? I was born in the Netherlands, and consider myself not Dutch per se but definitely an Amsterdammer. Truth be told, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to São Tomé and Principe, and the parent who hails from there left when he was ten.</description>

      <description>My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it&amp;rsquo;s like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He&amp;rsquo;s the person who was so discombobulated by Dutch white innocence, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He&amp;rsquo;s doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive.</description>

      <description>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could&amp;rsquo;ve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult.</description>
