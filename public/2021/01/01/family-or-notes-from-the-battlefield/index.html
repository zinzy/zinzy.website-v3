        <p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br>
you know it’s another one<br>
“Trans Life Survivors”<br>
says the cover<br>
“Merry Christmas!”<br>
says your sister<br>
you have only been using<br>
they/them pronouns<br>
in private<br>
for a year or so<br>
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br>
the ex-gay book<br>
your other sister presented to you<br>
on your birthday last month</p>
<p>At family dinner you<br>
spend bathroom breaks in your<br>
childhood bedroom<br>
five in total<br>
logging on to talk to us<br>
about how the heavy things feel<br>
being the punching bag<br>
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br>
practises her right hook<br>
screaming fire about<br>
her trans classmate<br>
stings<br>
and<br>
it stings<br>
like a shattered jaw</p>
<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br>
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br>
Covid-style<br>
each of the siblings hosting<br>
the entire family<br>
for a portion of the day<br>
hopping from house to house<br>
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br>
a big family will<br>
At the fourth stop you are full<br>
zonking off into the distance<br>
catching the smiling face of your<br>
sister-in-law on the way there<br>
and you remember what<br>
it felt like when<br>
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>
<p>For you and them<br>
there is no Family<br>
not since you came out as non-binary<br>
and your parents<br>
yelled<br>
“check please”<br>
the only trace of<br>
those you came from<br>
is the card your grandmother sent<br>
She writes “I wanted you to<br>
know I support you”<br>
She is a sweetheart<br>
it is a teardrop in the desert<br>
that you cling to</p>
<p>Your father was no exception<br>
first the pandemic<br>
now the respirator<br>
the store has been extra busy these days<br>
but you’re getting by<br>
it’s keeping your mind off<br>
of how much he was hoping<br>
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br>
Today, the phone call<br>
from the hospital<br>
lets you know that<br>
he can come home for Christmas<br>
The disappointment you feel<br>
sits in your body like a monster</p>
<p>You have all the time in the world<br>
to tell me how you’re doing<br>
but not a moment to yourself<br>
to commit to the act<br>
with all those relatives in the house<br>
prone to restricting themselves to<br>
those parts of the Bible<br>
that make Christianity look easy<br>
and you being back<br>
in the home of your youth<br>
after the attempt<br>
confirms what you fear and<br>
what your parents have been saying<br>
is true about your life<br>
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br>
your father said<br>
You wonder how gay<br>
he knows you are<br>
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br>
the Pride flag that I sent you<br>
as a housewarming gift</p>
<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of HaShem is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>
