I knew when I decided to participate in 






  
  
  

<a href="https://birming.com/fabruary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ↗'] ">Robert Birming&rsquo;s Fabruary</a> that the post I would submit as my favorite would be something written by Lou.</p>
<p>What Lou&rsquo;s writing captures perfectly for me, is the honest, &ldquo;no muss, no fuss&rdquo; type of wisdom coming only from someone who has <em>been through it</em>. Perhaps I recognize in Lou&rsquo;s story some of my own experiences with addiction, loss, and learning to cherish the good in my life. His stories are among the things I look forward to most when opening my RSS reader.</p>
<p>Anyway, reading about his first seven jobs was a fun way to see that every generation has its <em>remember whens</em>. He thinks of glass bottles, I of plastic ones. Remember when my cousin and I would stroll the neighborhood looking for old ladies with pending returnables? When I make my way through my employment history, a variety of things come to mind.</p>

<h3 id="job-0-the-one-that-got-away">Job 0: The one that got away</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think about my first seven jobs without mentioning this. I&rsquo;ll never feel cool enough to really <em>belong</em>, but my hometown&rsquo;s skater scene is the closest thing I have to community. Age fifteen, and I walk into the town&rsquo;s skate shop, which ironically sells more paraphernalia than actual skateboards. I&rsquo;m there with my mother to deliver a hand-written application letter. It says I look forward to getting their call. I forget to include my phone number.</p>
<h3 id="job-1-garden-center-cashier">Job 1: Garden center cashier</h3>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m from, the garden center is a common hangout for children and their parents on a boring, rainy Sunday. For about a year, I man the cash register and make friends along the way, writing notes on cash register paper, and spending what little money I make on the snacks by the exit. I eventually get promoted to 






  
  
  

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA9kQuWkU7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ↗'] ">assistant to the manager</a> of Home Decor. At the time, I think it&rsquo;s because of my creative disposition. Looking back, it&rsquo;s probably because I&rsquo;m too accomplished at getting rolls of bills stuck in the safety shute.</p>
<h3 id="job-2-server">Job 2: Server</h3>
<p>Quitting the garden center and quitting trade school happen around the same time. Like many other (neurodivergent) people (of color) in the Netherlands, I&rsquo;m a stacker: graduating with the lowest degree, working my way up to where I need to be. I knew from the start of Orientation, but I last half a semester anyway.</p>
<p>Rather than sit at home, I figure I&rsquo;ll do what my friends have done before me: make pretty good money working in the service industry. I find a place overlooking the town square that happily gives me a trial shift. I&rsquo;m nervous, intimidated by the pace, overwhelmed by all those table numbers, and drop a dozen bottles of chocolate milk, making a total mess. It&rsquo;s a disaster. My mother&rsquo;s looking on from behind a tree nearby, crying. Through it, I inherit her fearful disposition, which will take years to shed.</p>
<h3 id="job-3-the-newspaper-shop--dry-cleaner-employee">Job 3: The newspaper shop / dry cleaner employee</h3>
<p>Selling cigarettes and magazines two doors down from the cafe is quite fun. I get to drink chocolate milk without creating a mess, and my friends drop by every now and then during smoke breaks. I&rsquo;ll never understand what type of person gets their dry-cleaning done where cigarettes are consumed. I&rsquo;ll also never understand how my high school drop-out manager can enjoy taking her lunch break in the tiny, windowless back room. Soon after, I move to the next step on my academic ladder.</p>
<h3 id="job-4-outlet-retail-worker">Job 4: Outlet retail worker</h3>
<p>The GED program was supposed to be one year, but having failed three subjects, I take another year to meet the bare requirement: a passing grade in History. I have plenty of spare time to work at Bodum, one of the shops in our outlet shopping mall. I get really good at demonstrating their coffee machines, and have fun with coworkers analyzing the clientele. Somehow, I always feel like a failure for not seeing the appeal of that outlet mall and the old-fashioned storefronts that aren&rsquo;t fooling anyone.</p>
<h3 id="job-5-call-center-super-star">Job 5: Call center super star</h3>
<p>My first experience in college is in an actual city, where I soon find employment at my friend&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s call center. I turn out to be disturbingly skilled, first at selling newspapers, and soon after at tricking the elderly into buying a subscription to a service &ldquo;that will enter into all of the Internet&rsquo;s sweepstakes&rdquo; for them. I memorize the script so easily I make it to the end while reading a college textbook. My girlfriend at the time is appalled to notice that my voice has developed the cadence of a salesperson.</p>
<h3 id="job-6-academic-assistant">Job 6: Academic assistant</h3>
<p>Flunking out of college means I, once again, have plenty of time on my hands. Luckily, I have applied to an academic assistant job at the school&rsquo;s career center, where I get to manage its front desk and conduct aptitude and career tests. I like the job, for one because it&rsquo;s my first experience working in an office with actual adults, and for two because it&rsquo;s really good money. After about nine months, the department director discovers we&rsquo;re over budget by 400%, and they let all the assistants go as a result.</p>
<h3 id="job-7-postal-worker">Job 7: Postal worker</h3>
<p>Luckily for me, PostNL is hiring. It&rsquo;s the Dutch postal service, a mega corp struggling with productivity after failed mergers and privatization. Summer&rsquo;s approaching, and I am <em>hot</em>. Cutbacks mean we&rsquo;re allowed one 0,5L bottle of water on our route, and since I mostly deliver in my own neighborhood, I usually encounter a few friendly faces who refill my bottle. 






  
  
  


  <a href="/2009/08/01/the-first-dog-to-look-at-me-wrong/" class="">One day, after biking in the scorching heat for hours, I faint, landing in the bushes with a stack of mail in my hand</a>. It&rsquo;s all for a good cause, though, because that Autumn, after passing my adult entry exam with flying colors, I finally enroll in university.</p></content>
