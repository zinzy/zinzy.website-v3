<li>Finished the first stage of our bathroom remodel. While Anja, did the vast majority of the work, we managed to collaborate well on putting together the medicine cabinet. I quickly lost the ability to understand anyone who does not have storage space behind their mirrors.</li>
<li>I walked from the office to a favorite coffee spot with coworker C., mostly without crutches! It was a win, endurance-wise, but a failure in self control. I spent the rest of the week feeling the ramifications of this adventure.</li>
<li>Anja and I took an amazing pottery workshop at Pansa. She has been a member there for years, but hadn&rsquo;t been since her head injury in April. I was hoping this beginner&rsquo;s workshop would give her back her confidence, and I seem to have succeeded. Of course, I, too, will be signing up for their full workshop.</li>

<h3 id="stuff-i-did">Stuff I did</h3>
<p>Work was amazing: very few feature design balls to juggle, and ample time to work on discovery and research projects. I got great feedback from a coworker about a research project I recently wrapped up, and was invited to share about it more broadly. It aligns well with one of my professional goals of 2025: to standardize research efforts across our entire product development department. I&rsquo;m excited about it!</p>
<p>One of my coworkers who&rsquo;s in amateur theater asked me to design the poster for the their next play. I got to doodling right away, and a week later, we&rsquo;ve got a beautiful draft that I&rsquo;ll be fleshing into something more substantial in Procreate. It&rsquo;s fun to work on my iPad to create something like this. I&rsquo;ll be able to share it once it&rsquo;s done. (2025-02-21 update:

<h3 id="consumed">Consumed</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve begun watching <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, which I&rsquo;m not sure I love, but which does amuse me with its untypical protagonist. Much like the week before I went back to the hospital a second time, I am still watching that 






  
  
  


  <a href="/2025/01/12/week-2-pruning/" class="">horribly brilliant Dutch show about K-list levenslied singers</a>. At this point it has been two months, and I&rsquo;m not even embarrassed anymore. I feel like a discoverer on a mission in my psyche, looking to uncovere why in the godforsaken world anyone would binge watch a three-season reality show on single repeat.</p>
<h3 id="purchased">Purchased</h3>
<p>Two coworkers and I had our first of what I hope to many editions of the Finer Things Club. Our inaugural dinner was at Hoi Tin, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town. I tipped royally and paid €150. Pretty cheap for a mountain of dim sum, soup, and sizzling deliciousness! I bought the most appropriate Valentine&rsquo;s Day card I could&rsquo;ve ever found: €4,40. Now that I&rsquo;m getting around more, my public transport spending is on the rise. An acceptable €30,24 this week, but I wonder when enough will be enough.</p>

<p>The first three weeks of February are always busy: our anniversary, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and Anja&rsquo;s birthday are ample reasons to celebrate, but I usually struggle to find the right balance without overloading Anja with gifts that are cute in the moment, but that don&rsquo;t really leave a lasting impression. What <em>has</em> been leaving a lasting impression is how well we communicate, and how we work together to make our home a sanctuary. This week, she worked tirelessly on the bathroom, and it is so beautiful I now want to take ten showers a day.</p>
<h3 id="wondered">Wondered</h3>
<p>How can I make bathroom grout white-white afgain? How many days are there between February 15 and March 18? How was Staples founded? What&rsquo;s the 30-Day Cycle in the Episcopal tradition? What&rsquo;s a good recipe for creamy mushroom dal? How about for jollof? How&rsquo;s Justin Hall doing? How much is a ceramics wheel? What does a lotus look like? What&rsquo;s the name of that show about the boy who has a friend whose parents are poor migrant workers and live in a semi-basement?</p>
<h3 id="something-to-improve">Something to improve</h3>
<p>This week, with all its beautiful encounters, fun work projects, and gorgeous bathroom developments, was a bit of a chaotic one. I didn&rsquo;t take enough time to do my physical therapy exercises at home, or take enough rest in general. I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing better in that regard next week.</p></content>
