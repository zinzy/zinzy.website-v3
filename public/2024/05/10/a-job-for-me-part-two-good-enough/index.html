  <a href="/2024/04/20/a-job-for-me-part-one/" class="">part two of a reflection</a> on a conversation I had with a neurodivergent designer from Denmark. She asked me: how can I be promoted to the all-star Core Team at work, the one that works across products and teams?</p>
<p>Here I am.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I think about being a neurodivergent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> designer, I think back to 2001, and the math workbook that plagued me. For the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why it required that I study addition and multiplication before I look at the order of operations. It&rsquo;s one of many examples.</p>
<p>I spent a lifetime thinking I was <em>thinking</em> wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2024 and we&rsquo;re in the age of neurodivergence. My childhood math problem is now easy to explain. My brain is a meta thinker; it prefers skips and analogies<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and lets me learn rapidly if it can look at the world (and math) from the top down. It can remember minute details, but will forget the secondary task it&rsquo;s given. My brain thrives in chaotic passion.</p>
<p>In my mid-thirties, I know to care for my brain the way I care for my dog: with great devotion.</p>
<p>Whenever a similarly-neurodivergent designer asks me how they can be promoted from the Search Box team to the superstar Core Team, I usually tell them: go find a new employer. As workers, we continuously ask ourselves: am I doing a good enough job? There&rsquo;s great value in an additional question: is this environment good enough for me?</p>
<p>Us &ldquo;neurospicies&rdquo; must deal with an inevitability in the way the tech industry organizes product-making. The larger a company, the more likely it is that makers work on the parts before they get to work on the whole because the world assumes they&rsquo;re <em>able</em> to work on the whole only once the parts have been understood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfectly healthy way of looking at human skills, but we should remember that this way is very neurotypical. Neurotypical individuals may demonstrate a correlation between their system thinking abilities and their years of experience. For neurodivergent people, the ability to think systemically can be a very ineffective growth indicator that leaves us feeling unsatisfied in our jobs.</p>
<p>Go find yourself a smaller company, one in need of a  generalist designer who can work across all products, offering research, visual design, facilitation skills, interaction design, and whatever else is required. Not because you think you&rsquo;re the cat&rsquo;s meow, but because there&rsquo;s no other way for you to <em>think</em>.</p>
