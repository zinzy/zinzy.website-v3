<p>I said yes, but I had meant to say no.</p>
<hr>
<p>On occasion, Anja and I joke that, if circumstances required, I could even strike up a friendship with a traffic light. I never understood the challenge of meeting new people if it wasn&rsquo;t at work or the gym. The vast majority of my friendships formed because I looked at someone across the room and thought, for whatever reason, <em>wow</em>.</p>
<p>Six days later, here we are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, do you also believe that&hellip;&rdquo; the woman asks, sounding slightly more alarmed than I think she wants to let on. No, I don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;And what do you think about&hellip;&rdquo; Many things, ma&rsquo;am. I think many things about that. &ldquo;But you could have found that sense of belonging with any other group, though, right?&rdquo; The familiar caution when someone realizes I&rsquo;m both who I say I am <em>as well as</em> a Christian. The bemusement that engulfs us when a thing blurs that was clear but a second ago.</p>
<hr>
<p>Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say <em>I follow Jesus</em>. Cringe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re meant to put it into words, anyway. Still, millions of sermons, door-to-door pitches, books, podcasts, mission project plans, and ‚Äî more recently ‚Äî #ThatChristianGirl prayer routine videos will have us believe differently.</p>
<p>Yes, but actually no. What I find in Jesus is not what I would find in a sports team, a choir, or a book club. But what <em>do</em> I find there, and how can I tell you about it if you ask without sounding like a nut case?</p>
<hr>
<p>Ever since I met the woman for drinks, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how my pastor helped me through Mark 16:15 recently. I&rsquo;m thankful I wasn&rsquo;t the only person at Bible study who shivered at the thought of standing by Central Station with a tower of Bible leaflets. That&rsquo;s what &ldquo;proclaiming the good news&rdquo; is, right?</p>
<p>I have so few proper examples of what Mark 16:15 looks like in the hands of a person such as myself, that I question their statistical validity. My faith proclamation has often taken the shape of a concession. The formula is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite Christianity&rsquo;s hyperfocus on the virgin birth, the resurrection, Biblical literalism, and faith healings, I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>Despite Christianity&rsquo;s queerphobia, antisemitism, philosemitism, racism, abuse, mysogyny, misandry, and corruption, I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>Despite Christianity&rsquo;s judgement of what is harmless, and forgiveness of what is harmful, I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>Despite our global lack of Biblical literacy, I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>Despite &hellip;, I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>Despite &hellip;</p>
<p>Despite.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Do you want to hear good news?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the good news.</p>
<p>Preach it at all times, and use words if you must.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good news to a rose?</p>
