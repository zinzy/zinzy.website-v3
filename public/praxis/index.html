<p>Here&rsquo;s one fact that never fails to bring shock, surprise, confusion, or mild disdain into my conversations: I&rsquo;m an active congregant of a Christian fellowship, and I do my best to follow Jesus. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m actually on the church board. I suppose the emotions this fact elicits stem from the understanding people have of me as a queer person of color who seems, at least to some degree, level-headed.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-become-a-christian">How did you become a Christian?</h3>
<p>As an infant, I was baptized in the Dutch Catholic Church. At home, there was little interest in dogma, but I would say I grew up culturally Catholic: Church on Christmas and maybe Easter, children&rsquo;s prayers before bed, general lean towards feelings of guilt, on occasion a traumatized uncle would let rip on his time as an orphan living with the friars. The usual stuff.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-a-christian-are-you">What kind of a Christian are you?</h3>
<p>Today, I would refer to myself using the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-literal and non-dogmatic:</strong> I take the Bible too seriously to take it literally, and instead apply different reading techniques to find something new in it, again and again</li>
<li><strong>Orthoprax and profoundly subversive:</strong> I find great inspiration in the work of

<li><strong>In the world <em>and</em> of the world:</strong> I&rsquo;m not a Christian because I believe this world is not my final resting place; instead I try to root in my spiritual practice the knowledge that how I practice my faith is most important for the here and now</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-what-about">But what about&hellip;</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to be in a church that looks Christianity straight in the ugly face. I think it&rsquo;s important to practice hurt acknowledgement<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I acknowledge the major harm the Christian tradition has caused. I&rsquo;m comfortable saying Christianity is one of the worst developments in human history from at least the reign of Constantine the Great onwards.</p>
<p>The spiritual, socio-geographical, psychological, physical, sexual, political and other forms of violent acts committed in the name of Jesus span centuries, generations, continents. A part of Christianity&rsquo;s skillset is to discriminate, reject, destroy, exclude, minimize, abuse. People of color everywhere, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Jews, children, and countless others know this all too well.</p>
<p>Some people tell me that, because I have familiarity with much of this, I should outright reject the Church. But here I am. I believe very strongly that I, too, can own the stories of Jesus. They don&rsquo;t belong to the people who seek to continue to benefit from that skillset. I think the Church <em>can</em> be a place where people heal from the very atrocities committed in the name of Jesus. I believe they can heal <em>with</em> the stories and memory of Jesus, not despite him.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-practice">How I practice</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, praxis is the most important thing in my faith life. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I dutifully adhere to the 613 commandments introduced in the Tanakh. Instead, I constantly seek ways to be subversive for the cause of love of God and neighbor. Here are some things that help me with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m interested in Ignatian discernment, which I see as a way of understand what <em>does</em> contribute to that cause in any circumstance. It involves becoming very still, and learning to listen intently.</li>
<li>To remind myself of what I find important, I try to show up for prayer and reading every day. One of our priests likes to say she &ldquo;prays her way into the day&rdquo;, and I like that, too. Showing up for the text is a humbling experience that takes me out of the day-to-day stresses of life for a bit.</li>
