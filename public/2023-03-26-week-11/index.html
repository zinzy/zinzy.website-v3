<li>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: <a href="patrickrhone.com">Patrick Rhone</a> and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/13189-2/">to catch the planning stage on his blog</a> right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at <a href="http://www.cafedetuin.nl/">Cafe de Tuin</a>, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing &ldquo;raise a glass to freedom&rdquo;. Fine people, they are.</li>
<li>After another week with Lemonade, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel more confident about raising her to be a well-behaved, confident puppy. For the most part, she&rsquo;s doing very well. The only real challenge we have is the barking to which she&rsquo;ll resort every time she&rsquo;s in the crate but not sleeping. Through trial and error, we&rsquo;re slowly learning how to help her settle down more easily, and this week, the efforts have begun to pay off.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got some exciting news forthcoming that isn&rsquo;t quite ready for the public just yet, but it has managed to lift my spirits greatly. I&rsquo;ll be able to write more in the next few weeks, but for now it&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m feeling hopeful, inspired, and ready.</li>
<li>While Anja had apparently been around to watch season one when it was released, I&rsquo;ve only now turned onto the wonderful journey that is <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. I would never actually ask the universe for a reboot of <em>The Office: US</em>, but this new mockumentary revolving around a poorly-managed, underfunded Philadelphia public school has exactly the vibe I would&rsquo;ve hoped to get from that nonexistent reboot. It&rsquo;s just nice that, with this show, Black people are at the front and center.</li>
<li>Spring has officially begun, but as one of the regulars at my coffee place said: &ldquo;the question isn&rsquo;t when spring begins but when  rain ends&rdquo;. It seems the weather&rsquo;s getting better, though, and I can feel I&rsquo;m on the cusp of storing away my winter coat. It has been a long time coming.</li>
