        <p>The red thread in my life is bottomless curiosity for the world in which we live. To learn about fleeting interests, you should read my <a href="/now">Now</a> page. Below is an overview of the topics that have been with me for decades.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Hailing from a long line of band geeks, I got my first toy piano at age four, and I haven&rsquo;t been the same since. I know my way around most wind and percussion instruments, and developed a keen relationship first with the trumpet and the oboe, then the guitar, and now, finally, the piano. Making music is the single most effective tool in my mental health toolkit.</p>
<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>
<p>As a young adult I worked as a freelance photographer, and to this day I have a great appreciation for the art of photography. I have a few digital cameras, but most of my love I pour into my Polaroid. Take a look at my <a href="/instant">instant photography archive</a>.</p>
<h3 id="linguistics">Linguistics</h3>
<p>I was academically trained as a linguist and literary theorist and was on a path to a career in comics studies before making a pivot towards design. Languages still hold a place in my heart, and I often use language learning as a way to relax and keep me on my toes. Currently, I&rsquo;m diving into Korean, and enjoying it thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="indieweb">IndieWeb</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an advocate for an Internet that is kind, accessible, transparent, and designed to foster connection and understanding. There&rsquo;s great joy in maintaining my own website, and meeting many others who do the same.
Central questions that overarch my thinking and doing:</p>
<h3 id="other-things">Other things</h3>
<ul>
<li>How can design dynamically position itself as a service within an organization?</li>
<li>How can technology aid collaboration, inclusion, and knowledge building?</li>
<li>How does storytelling affect the lived experience and notion of self of individuals?</li>
<li>How can I learn to play that piece of music?</li>
<li>How does neurodiversity affect one&rsquo;s productivity?</li>
<li>How can I cook this better?</li>
</ul>
