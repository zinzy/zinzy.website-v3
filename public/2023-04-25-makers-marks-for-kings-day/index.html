        <p>It&rsquo;s late in the morning and I&rsquo;m on my way to Gerimedica, the company&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. I&rsquo;m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.</p>
<p>The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building I&rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of calling my office. I cross the river Amstel, enjoy the sun, and marvel at the preparations people have been making.</p>
<p>In two days, King&rsquo;s Day is upon us. It&rsquo;s always a big event in the country, and specifically in Amsterdam, and this year it&rsquo;s extra special: our king was coronated ten years ago this year. In our house it&rsquo;s not a big deal, in fact Anja couldn&rsquo;t be more of an anti-monarchist if she tried. Lemonade&rsquo;s too young to pay it any mind, I&rsquo;m sure. But the rest of the country is getting ready.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s Day is full of traditions: young children playing the violin out of tune at the park, tompouce pastries, the king and his family on a heavily-televised trip to a Dutch city that has been preparing for this moment for a year. And forever and for always: people securing a spot on the flea market route days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Today, as I biked across the city, I saw hundreds of them; 40 square feet of pavement taped off by people aiming to use that specific spot to spend their King&rsquo;s Day. Peddling by, I thought to myself that it was a rather sweet unwritten rule: I put my name here in a manner that you could erase at any moment, but Dutch custom says you&rsquo;re to honor my plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to people marking these spots &ldquo;bezet&rdquo; (&ldquo;taken&rdquo;) or adding their name for emphasis. Today, however, I noticed many people had made a small figure with their tape, a maker&rsquo;s mark of sorts. I&rsquo;m learning through Anja&rsquo;s ceramics adventure that this is entirely common in the potter community: a small, minimalist figure telling the world you made something.</p>
<p>I hope all those people get what they came for: that specific spot on the pavement, and a fun day to help them Konmari their house. In the meantime, I also hope that the Amsterdamse Bos is quiet on King&rsquo;s Day. I&rsquo;m looking to take Anja and Lemonade there for a quiet afternoon, far away from the crowds.</p>
