<p>Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.</p>
<p>I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know <em>everything</em> about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak. He laughs when I bop his nose, although I quickly learn that the force with which I bop Anja&rsquo;s adult nose shan&rsquo;t be applied here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a French bakery in Amsterdam that I visit on Wednesday with my colleague Ruby. Since their actual oven is somewhere else, I wonder if the shop even calls itself a bakery. After all, French standards would forbid it. The caramel √©clair reminds me of that time at

The bread has been in the window too long. I ask if they have plastic bags, and I&rsquo;m told no. I say I think that should be illegal in bakeries.</p>
<p>My childhood friend Mathilde comes for dinner on Sunday. Anja and I are giddy with excitement. In preparation, we practice our harmonies to Alanis Morissette&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ironic&quot;over voice messages. Her husband asks her if she, too, heard the cat meowing. We&rsquo;re celebrating her birthday, and I got her gifts at

When I ask them about the East-Asian gay guy who writes letters to his mom, they immediately give me Ocean Vuong&rsquo;s new book of poetry. Seeing her again, I better understand what It means to have a soulmate. I sing so loud I give myself a migraine. It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up

I was missing some functionalities that are natural to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault. I could make a spiel about how I love the &ldquo;slow web&rdquo;-ness of writing things on my phone and only publishing them when I&rsquo;m on my computer, but I simply haven&rsquo;t figured out how to do it any other way.</p>
