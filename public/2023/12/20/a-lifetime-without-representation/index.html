<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26029077" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">Dutch white innocence</a>, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He&rsquo;s doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive. He even joined a theatre group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember when you scolded me because my website was in Times New Roman?&rdquo; I ask him. He doesn&rsquo;t. Back when this happened, he was working a Dutch corporate job. Part of him, or perhaps all of him, must have been so embarrassed to learn he&rsquo;d sent his UX-hopeful coworker to a webpage that looked like it never left the late nineties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh look, another book on personal branding&rdquo; I say as we walk into American Book Center. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually really what I need&rdquo; he says. It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s hoping to be invited to SoHo House Amsterdam. &ldquo;That reminds me of, what&rsquo;s her name&hellip; Anna Delvey?&rdquo; I say. That&rsquo;s exactly what it is, he tells me. It&rsquo;s a private place for selected Amsterdam creatives. A country club in the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great. You can&rsquo;t take pictures in there, they let you connect with other creatives, and it&rsquo;s 200 euros a month. My friend rebranded herself in such a brilliant way, check out this picture of her with her paintings on Instagram. She got an invite right away.&rdquo; When I note that he moved a five-hour plane ride away from SoHo House Spuistraat, he seems surprised.</p>
<p>At Coffee Company, he shows me his blog, but he holds his hand over the title, of which I manage to catch a glimpse. It&rsquo;s such a weird name I forget it instantly, but the writing is beautiful. I&rsquo;m saddened by Gen Z&rsquo;s inability to just use their own bleeding name for stuff. I don&rsquo;t think the fragmentation is doing them any good.</p>
<p>I peer pressure him into getting one of those silly hand treatments at Lush, where the people always seem a little too eager to greet you. The person giving the treatment has a pronoun button on their apron, but still I get it wrong. &ldquo;Zinzy, her pronouns are they/them&rdquo; my friend says. Minutes later, I joke how I need an applause for managing to use the correct pronoun. The two most oppressed people on Kalverstraat, and we&rsquo;re mere inches away from becoming the boomers we avoid.</p>
<p>We finally land at Bar Bario, where the Callaloo Hoek staff has come down with covid. What a waste of a good appetite, I think, as I Uber us Ranchi sandwiches. Like two people on a date that can&rsquo;t find its pace, we take turns asking each other questions from the jar on the table. &ldquo;When was the first time you felt represented by the media?&rdquo; I ask him. &ldquo;Never&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> is your SoHo House,&rdquo; I say, waving my arms feverishly at the Black pride on the walls and queer people of color at the bar. &ldquo;<em>Your</em> people are <em>here</em>&rdquo;. He cries a little bit, but because he can&rsquo;t escape the characteristics of his generation, I can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s faking it, method acting, or just unable to cry like a normal person.</p>
