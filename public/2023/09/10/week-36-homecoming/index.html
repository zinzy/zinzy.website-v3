<li>IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later.

<li>There&rsquo;s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn&rsquo;t have been more excited to welcome my

<li>I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick&rsquo;s husband, couldn&rsquo;t make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.</li>
<li>I joined the V&amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we&rsquo;ve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.</li>
<li>Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.</li>
<li>I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to

<li>It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business. One minute we&rsquo;re talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.</li>
<li>On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I&rsquo;ve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it&rsquo;s becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.</li>
<li>On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop&rsquo;s garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.</li>
