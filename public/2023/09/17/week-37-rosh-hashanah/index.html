<li>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I&rsquo;ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I&rsquo;m writing this the sky is gray and it&rsquo;s raining, but this week&rsquo;s weather was cheerful and moderate.</li>
<li>On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I&rsquo;ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a <em>lot</em> from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.</li>
<li>I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn&rsquo;t be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I&rsquo;m fortunate to call her my friend.</li>
<li>I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale&rsquo;s <em>

To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people&rsquo;s websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.</li>
<li>Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to inviting them to our place.</li>
<li>On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja&rsquo;s bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like

<li>At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.</li>

<li>Much like the last few days, I&rsquo;m not in the best of states. There&rsquo;s an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I&rsquo;m slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m nearing the end of my journal, and I&rsquo;m surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past,
