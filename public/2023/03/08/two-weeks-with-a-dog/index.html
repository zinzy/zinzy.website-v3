<h3 id="the-roi-of-good-research">The ROI of good research</h3>
<p>Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found 






  
  
  

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">McCann Dogs</a>, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.</p>
<p>Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn&rsquo;t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it&rsquo;s great to see how quickly she&rsquo;s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann&rsquo;s course 






  
  
  

<a href="https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">Puppy Essentials</a>, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.</p>
<h3 id="i-got-cabin-fever">I got cabin fever</h3>
<p>Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we&rsquo;ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.</p>
<p>Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn&rsquo;t actually let her <em>walk</em> just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It&rsquo;s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.</p>
<h3 id="the-beauty-of-trust">The beauty of trust</h3>
<p>Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they&rsquo;ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it&rsquo;s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she&rsquo;s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.</p>
