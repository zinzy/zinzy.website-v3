<a href="https://queer-amsterdam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">Queer Amsterdam</a> is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.</p>
<p>On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &ldquo;an anonymous friend&rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wear my face mask&rdquo; he says, 20 minutes into the event. &ldquo;Am I getting too close?&rdquo; I ask, concerned. No, he just doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable being photographed. The off chance that his parents may see him is not worth it.</p>
<p>As we walk, I think about the meaning of the word &ldquo;pride&rdquo;. If we walk in a Pride March, can we be proud without wanting to be photographed and broadcast for anyone to see? A sign in the crowd reads &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be what you can&rsquo;t see&rdquo;, and I agree. Representation is crucial, to this my life is a testament. But what burden does that place on people whose visibility is dangerous to themselves?</p>
<p>The intersection of queerdom, the way it interacts with ethnicity, religion, ability, neurodivergence, age, education, and location, is why I&rsquo;m here today. Why I&rsquo;m here at all. Mehdi, who has never attended a Pride event in his life, learns to shout along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do we want?<br>
TRANS RIGHTS!<br>
When do we want them?<br>
NOW!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speeches this year spark my interest. 






  
  
  

<a href="https://pride.amsterdam/ambassadors/tieneke-sumter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ‚Üó'] ">Tieneke</a> talks about consent, an oft-overlooked point of concern in our queer communities. Someone whose name I forgot talks about bisexuality. I remember how unsettling it was as a young adult that people told me I was &ldquo;in transit&rdquo;, on my way to being either gay or straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here today shouting for myself, a little bit, but also to engage in the praxis of allyship which is by default an aspirational habit: doing the things we know to be right, without determining for other people whether we can call ourselves their allies.</p>
