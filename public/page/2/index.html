              <p>An enjoyable part of my day job is that I get to hyper-segment healthcare professionals into neat groups based on age, personality types, gender, educational level, tech-savviness, and behavioral patterns. I believe fervently that data can do good, which is: help healthcare professionals practice their <em>craft</em> and not spend 35% of their time on the menial tasks that make up the administrative part of their job.</p>
<p>I love that my employer is as excited about data as I am, and that I get to geek out with dashboards and spreadsheets to help development teams make better decisions.</p>
<p>At home, though, it&rsquo;s a different story. One of the things I like most about my website is that I don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;ve been here unless you tell me. I stopped using analytics tooling on my personal website a long time ago, and I like it that way.</p>
<p>For a few years now I&rsquo;ve had a standing invitation to 






  
  
  


  <a href="/hello" class="">say hello</a>. It has been providing me with friendly conversations with Internet strangers for years. It&rsquo;s pleasant when some random guy from the American Midwest emails me to ask how my ankle is doing. Using the contact form on my hello page, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce that there is now yet another way for you to let me know you&rsquo;ve been here. It&rsquo;s by signing my brand-new 






  
  
  


  <a href="/guestbook" class="">guestbook</a>! I love seeing what people write on a website maker&rsquo;s public wall, and I hope my page will slowly fill up with nice words from all over the world.</p>
<p>See you there?</p>

<p>Daddy Cross, my friend and coworker with the best nickname in the world, is usually a very bold woman. The kind of power house I imagine Julia Louis-Dreyfus to be. Speaks truth to power in a voice that can do all sorts of things. Best physical comedy I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a person. But I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, because she&rsquo;s a total theater kid. Last week, as I hobbled my way past her desk, she asked, in a squeaky voice: &ldquo;Are you busy, like, in general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never busy. I learned early on in University that answering the question &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; with &ldquo;Oh my, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> busy&rdquo; was both boring and unproductive. I always reserve space for emergency design work, on-the-fly meetings, and time-sensitive requests. But Daddy Cross&rsquo; question wasn&rsquo;t about work.</p>

                <p>One of the sweeter developments of 2025 so far has been our commitment to watch all of <em>Seinfeld</em>. Expecting the dull inner laugh unnoticeable to any bystander that I produce under <em>Friends</em>, I&rsquo;m struck by its brilliant writing, hilarious approach to nihilism, and the string of supporting characters who went on to become stars.</p>
<p><em>Seinfeld</em>, however, wouldn&rsquo;t be where it is today in our home (halfway through season five) if we hadn&rsquo;t first watched <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, the mockumentary about <em>Seinfeld</em> creator Larry David.</p>

<h3 id="three-wins">Three wins</h3>
<ol>
<li>Finished the first stage of our bathroom remodel. While Anja, did the vast majority of the work, we managed to collaborate well on putting together the medicine cabinet. I quickly lost the ability to understand anyone who does not have storage space behind their mirrors.</li>
<li>I walked from the office to a favorite coffee spot with coworker C., mostly without crutches! It was a win, endurance-wise, but a failure in self control. I spent the rest of the week feeling the ramifications of this adventure.</li>
<li>Anja and I took an amazing pottery workshop at Pansa. She has been a member there for years, but hadn&rsquo;t been since her head injury in April. I was hoping this beginner&rsquo;s workshop would give her back her confidence, and I seem to have succeeded. Of course, I, too, will be signing up for their full workshop.</li>

              <p>I dreamed I added my profile picture to an IndieWeb directory. Upon visiting the website in question, I noticed how my initial difficulty to correctly operate my phone&rsquo;s photo library had resulted in two pictures. The first one showed my face, and the second did, too. Scrolling down, though, any viewer would immediately be met with my bare chest. I panicked, and thought about people who fall victim to revenge porn. &ldquo;Would my pictures be eligible for removal&rdquo;, I wondered, &ldquo;even if I was the one who committed the act?&rdquo; I spent the rest of the saga stressed and horrified. Moments later, I wake up to Valentine&rsquo;s Day, fully clothed.</p>
