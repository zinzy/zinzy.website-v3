      <description>[[Codex]] Codex, Week 2: Omek&#xA;Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene (she/they) and this is my personal website; a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. It’s a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. On this website as well as in life, I aim to bring my whole self: the self that works, plays, questions, doodles, fears, cooks, prays, gets angry, changes her mind.</description>

      <description>The red thread in my life is bottomless curiosity for the world in which we live. I enjoy doing short deep-dives into all sorts of subjects. Some stay, but with many I&amp;rsquo;ll reach a point of satisfaction at some point, ready to take on something new. To learn about the more fleeting interests occupying my mind, you should read my Now page. Below is an overview of the themes that have been with me for decades.</description>

      <description>Last updated in December 2023.&#xA;Here I am at Coffee Company Oosterdok, pondering what I&amp;rsquo;ll have for lunch. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my winter break, which I spend at museums, the library, cafes, the park. A lot of walking is involved. Like David Sedaris, I scoff at days I complete with only 10,000 steps. I just checked out three books from the library. One to fill me with spiritual familiarity, one to reacquaint me with maths, and one to help me learn Korean.</description>

      <description>I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people&amp;rsquo;s hand-built blogs. The sense of whimsy, coziness, and a beautiful lack of information overload are highs I have been chasing ever since. The Web 1.0 has instilled in me a deep appreciation for a small-scale, intimate, and friendly Internet made up of hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.&#xA;I’ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a researcher, developer, designer, design manager, and product manager in technology companies across a variety of industries. I hold a BA in Linguistics and Literature from Utrecht University, and dropped out of seminary a decade ago. I take a Ted Lasso approach to building products: I care little about my job title, and a lot about whatever activity will help us solve problems more effectively.&#xA;Title Company Timeline Senior UX Researcher &amp;amp; Designer Gerimedica 2023 - Design &amp;amp; Product Manager Leeruniek 2020 - 2023 Lead Designer Airtrade 2015 - 2020 Designer &amp;amp; Developer Studio Zinzy 2007 - 2015 Case studies The majority of my work is protected by non-disclosure agreements.</description>
