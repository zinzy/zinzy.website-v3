        <p>I&rsquo;m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I&rsquo;m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work is so great!&rdquo; I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn&rsquo;t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through <em>1984</em>. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says &ldquo;like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s, like, just typically English&rdquo;, and we both smile.</p>
<p>After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A&rsquo;s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.</p>
<p>On Thursday, my <a href="/now">Now</a> page is published on <a href="https://nownownow.com/p/Tptv">nownownow.com</a>. After a beautiful day at the home office, I&rsquo;m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don&rsquo;t need her parentification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.</p>
<p>I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649692/"><em>Surviving Death</em></a> episodes on mediums. A tells me she&rsquo;s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.</p>
<p>On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven&rsquo;t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.</p>
