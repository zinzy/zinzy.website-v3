<p>Hello, I‚Äôm Zinzy Waleson Geene. This is my personal website. I believe firmly in the practice of showing up in fullness; nuances and flaws included.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this website is a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. No highlight reel, no likes, no follow button. You may

<h3 id="in-short">In short</h3>
<p>I am what some would consider an edge case: Afropean, neurodivergent, queer, non-binary, a Jesus follower, and a survivor of domestic violence. Midway along the journey of my life (hopefully), I finally feel comfortable to say that my search for kinfolk is a bare necessity.</p>
<h3 id="in-long">In long</h3>
<p>If you meet me in person, you&rsquo;ll see I like to laugh a lot. It&rsquo;s not fake, either. I&rsquo;m just pleased to be where I am today. Ever since I was a child, I expected my mid-thirties to bring peace, clarity, and a reduction in fucks given. I was right. I&rsquo;m looking forward to my mid-fifties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of S√£o Tom√©an and Dutch descent and come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany. Being neurodivergent, queer, and a person of color meant I only began to feel a sense of belonging when I moved to Amsterdam. Its ability to help me recognize myself in the people around me will never seize to be a requirement for my living arrangements.</p>
<p>While I had great plans for myself academically, I have yet to decide how I&rsquo;ll spend my Master&rsquo;s degree becoming what I want to be when I grow up. I studied Modern Lit and Linguistics at Utrecht University, and embarked on the VU University track to become a pastor. Meanwhile, I had started a design practice in 2007 that, by now, is an enjoyable career in Information Technology. Academia has taught me most of what I know about reading and writing. It also taught me that everything is a text.</p>
<p>Music has always played an important role in my life. Like all my cousins and friends, I was enrolled in music classes from a very young age. Starting on the recorder, I eventually devoted myself to the trumpet, the oboe, and most other wind instruments found in your average local orchestra. In elementary school, I taught myself to play the guitar, which gave me access to a string of&hellip; string instruments. These days, you can often find me at the piano.</p>
<p>In various forms and frequencies, I&rsquo;ve been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I&rsquo;m an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.</p>
<p>My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would&rsquo;ve had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sober since May 2018.</p>
