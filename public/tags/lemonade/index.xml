      <description>Met [[Tim Bleeker|Tim Bleeker]] at [[Somerlust Park|Somerlust Park]] on [[2023-08-22|Tuesday]], a get-together that started as &amp;ldquo;chilling in the park&amp;rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&amp;rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&amp;rsquo; requests.</description>

      <description>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: Patrick Rhone and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough to catch the planning stage on his blog right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at Cafe de Tuin, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing &amp;ldquo;raise a glass to freedom&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year. After two weeks of cocooning, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it says about me that I find it annoying when people don&amp;rsquo;t recognize that my puppy is a corgi.</description>

      <description>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loul√©. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A godmother was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.&#xA;The ROI of good research Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation.</description>
