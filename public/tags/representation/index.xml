      <description>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I&amp;rsquo;m a part, a White lesbian asked me: &amp;ldquo;when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like me join?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great questions,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;my response is identical to what you would say if someone went &amp;lsquo;why do you need lesbian bars?

It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention.</description>
