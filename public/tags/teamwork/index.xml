      <description>Met [[Tim Bleeker|Tim Bleeker]] at [[Somerlust Park|Somerlust Park]] on [[2023-08-22|Tuesday]], a get-together that started as &amp;ldquo;chilling in the park&amp;rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&amp;rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&amp;rsquo; requests.</description>
