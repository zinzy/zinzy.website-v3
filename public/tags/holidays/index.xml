      <description>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this the sky is gray and it&amp;rsquo;s raining, but this week&amp;rsquo;s weather was cheerful and moderate. On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required.</description>

      <description>Two months of onboarding have rushed by in a blink. The new job is absolutely wonderful: the people are great, the work is complex and important, and the office itself is perhaps the finest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked at. I joined this company because the challenges they have seemed interesting to me. I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that, two months in, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to think that, at one point in time, these challenges weren&amp;rsquo;t also mine.</description>

      <description>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate! Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said &amp;ldquo;where are the tea lights?&amp;rdquo;, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</description>

      <description>Christmas break is passing by me like it passes by an ambitious teenager. I greeted all the things I could do with great enthusiasm. Sadly, that feeling quickly turned into terror once I realised two weeks isn’t that long and I need to sleep.&#xA;Productivity-wise, man can only fail under such conditions, this I know.&#xA;Meanwhile, I keep being amazed by the weather in Haarlem. I managed to take some photos downtown last week that remind me of the beginning of September, despite a winter coat here and rain hat there.</description>
