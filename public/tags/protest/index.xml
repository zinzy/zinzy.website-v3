      <description>The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I&amp;rsquo;m at Basquiat waiting to catch up with a friend, and an Irish woman strikes up a conversation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can&amp;rsquo;t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the Women&amp;rsquo;s March. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t often attend protests, not in the last place because I&amp;rsquo;m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can&amp;rsquo;t be very positive.</description>
