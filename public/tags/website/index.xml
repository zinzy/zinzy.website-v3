      <description> Updated the general UI of this website by adding a softer background color Added a splice method I used earlier to photo posts, which allows me to alter the size of the images served through Cloudinary Merged _notes contents into my _posts folder so that my dated content is organized in a single place (this is convenient for pagination purposes) Styled the tags page Updated layout of an individual tag page so that short notes and posts are grouped accordingly </description>

      <description>My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it&amp;rsquo;s like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He&amp;rsquo;s the person who was so discombobulated by Dutch white innocence, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He&amp;rsquo;s doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive.</description>
