      <description>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted &amp;ldquo;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&amp;rdquo;. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.&#xA;I was there for four reasons:&#xA;My definition of God is &amp;ldquo;science is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her&amp;rdquo; I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event The Dutch carnival season had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman.</description>

      <title>What Pride means to me in 2023</title>

      <description>Nienke, Mehdi, an anonymous friend, and I attend the annual Pride March. It&amp;rsquo;s the city&amp;rsquo;s first two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term &amp;ldquo;queer&amp;rdquo;, I am pleased Queer Amsterdam is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.&#xA;On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &amp;ldquo;an anonymous friend&amp;rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</description>
