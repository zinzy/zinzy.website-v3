      <description>Life sure is different now that we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten Lemonade on a proper walking schedule. She still feels most comfortable going potty on the puppy pads we have on our balcony, but she absolutely loves going out and exploring the neighborhood.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how well she walks on a loose leash, and how few issues we&amp;rsquo;ve had with the stuff she puts in her mouth. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make most use of her imprint period, and that means familiarizing her with as many different things as possible.</description>
