      <description>What I love most about today&amp;rsquo;s snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade&amp;rsquo;s eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.</description>

      <description>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year. After two weeks of cocooning, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block.</description>

      <title>Two weeks with a dog</title>

      <description>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A godmother was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.&#xA;The ROI of good research Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation.</description>

      <title>Dog park</title>

      <description>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.&#xA;The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season.</description>

      <title>Prospective dog owners</title>

      <description>I’m in that supremely annoying stage of prospective dog ownership where I casually interrogate dog owners at parties, curious about their pet’s behavior and the techniques employed, and then silently judge them for their mistakes, exchanging contemptuous glances with Anja in the process.</description>

      <title>Everything about the dog</title>

      <description>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we&amp;rsquo;ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We&amp;rsquo;re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I&amp;rsquo;m crying.&#xA;2022 showed me that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality.</description>
