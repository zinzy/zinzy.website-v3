      <description>Met [[Tim Bleeker|Tim Bleeker]] at [[Somerlust Park|Somerlust Park]] on [[2023-08-22|Tuesday]], a get-together that started as &amp;ldquo;chilling in the park&amp;rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&amp;rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&amp;rsquo; requests.</description>

      <description>The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I&amp;rsquo;m just landing. No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam isnâ€™t using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be.</description>
