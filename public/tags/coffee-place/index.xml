      <description>I met Shervin at the coffee place this morning. We know each other very casually; we used to frequent the same co-working space, we&amp;rsquo;re LinkedIn friends. He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.&#xA;We exchange how life is treating us, what we&amp;rsquo;re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing.</description>
