      <description>Nienke, Mehdi, an anonymous friend, and I attend the annual Pride March. It&amp;rsquo;s the city&amp;rsquo;s first two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term &amp;ldquo;queer&amp;rdquo;, I am pleased Queer Amsterdam is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.&#xA;On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write &amp;ldquo;an anonymous friend&amp;rdquo; instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</description>

      <title>Eight of ten</title>

      <description>When I first set foot in the Old Catholic Church to attend an All Saints service, I knew I had found a special place. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.&#xA;It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times.</description>

      <title>All Saints Amsterdam</title>

      <description>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how new the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it&amp;rsquo;s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.&#xA;You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but fangirl.</description>

      <title>Week 12: Bonsoihoir</title>

      <description>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you &amp;ldquo;leave it cleaner than you found it&amp;rdquo; and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re gone after two days. At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury.</description>

      <title>When Jesus sent out his Twelve</title>

      <description>This was written as part of Vine &amp;amp; Fig&amp;rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.&#xA;When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.&#xA;Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp;amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter.</description>

      <description>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren&amp;rsquo;t assigned at birth.&#xA;As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns.</description>

      <title>Of bridges and neighbors</title>

      <description>When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”&#xA;When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp;amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics.</description>

      <title>Hell is other people</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people&amp;rsquo;s bodies.</description>

      <title>The benefit of discontent</title>

      <description>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:&#xA;Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — America Magazine&#xA;My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn&amp;rsquo;t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions.</description>

      <description>This was originally published as part of the Vine &amp;amp; Fig &amp;ldquo;Pray Tell&amp;rdquo; project.&#xA;She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‘Hey dear!’ it sounds. ‘Happy Mother’s Day&amp;rsquo;, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.&#xA;As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again.</description>
