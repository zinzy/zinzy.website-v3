      <description>Nothing ungovernable, it&amp;rsquo;s more like a hum. The hum of I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling at my best, of can&amp;rsquo;t get that argument out of my head, of what if, what if, what if; a hum that I eventually forget is there at all, even though it never ceases to soundtrack my every move.</description>

      <description>The procrastinating part of me celebrates these words.
I want a good calendar app. One I&amp;rsquo;m excited to use, that works across devices, and is happy with multiple accounts that didn&amp;rsquo;t all originate in its own ecosystem.</description>

      <description>They open their roti takeout, unfold their pancake, and start eating. Strike a pose, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to it. I ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s okay that I watch them eat before I start, so I can see how in the world I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to eat sauce without cutlery.</description>

      <description>Remember Flickr, and the way we self-published visual sneak peeks into our lives on that website, in the mid-zeroes? If we wanted a filter in our photo, we had to Photoshop it in there ourselves.</description>

      <description>My pastors have a way with words. Bible study on Thursday, and we use every pronoun but &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; reading Mark 6:1-13. &lt;em&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s just a carpenter — Mary’s girl. Who does she think she is?&lt;/em&gt; Give me a second, let me hear that again.</description>

      <description>Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say &lt;em&gt;I follow Jesus&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t it one of God&amp;rsquo;s cruelest jokes, Manuele, our ability to feel imposter syndrome? When I read your post — late, obviously, because RSS feeds and I will never quite be best friends — I was struck by your openness on the matter.</description>

      <description>The March edition of the IndieWeb Carnival is about accessibility on the small web. The host, orchids, touches on a note-worthy design pattern found in this fine corner of the Internet: that of artsy, personal websites that emulate technology of old, particularly the early days of Internet.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a weekend-long dance workshop in town. While she&amp;rsquo;s certainly not our first house guest, the situation feels brand new. It must be the Japanese mattress we just bought, which turns our one-bedroom shoebox of an apartment into a temporary bed and breakfast (and lunch and dinner) for Anneli, the journalist from Sweden.</description>

      <description>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan.</description>

      <description>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at Triangle of Sadness and White Noise.</description>

      <description>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate! Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year.</description>

      <description>I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally don&amp;rsquo;t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to document what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.</description>

      <description>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style.</description>

      <description>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble understanding whether I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I&amp;rsquo;ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now.</description>

      <description>I never get much reading done unless I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I&amp;rsquo;m away from a computer screen.</description>

      <description>This was written as part of Vine &amp;amp; Fig&amp;rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.

      <description>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I&amp;rsquo;m a part, a White lesbian asked me: &amp;ldquo;when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness?</description>

      <description>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always able to execute on them.</description>
