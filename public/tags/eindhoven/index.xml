      <description>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother&amp;rsquo;s cousins&amp;rsquo; daughters&amp;rsquo; coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.&#xA;So here&amp;rsquo;s a change of strategy, and of pace.&#xA;This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled &amp;ldquo;DYKES!&amp;rdquo; at us.&#xA;I dislike such antics as much as the next gay. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the words &amp;ldquo;dyke&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fag&amp;rdquo; and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we&amp;rsquo;re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me.</description>
