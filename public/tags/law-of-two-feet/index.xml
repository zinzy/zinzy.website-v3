      <description>A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&amp;rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee. I seem to have found my way back to the [[Miracle morning|Miracle morning]] method. While I cringe at the very notion of self development, it has been great to start my day in quietude.</description>
