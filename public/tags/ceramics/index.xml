      <description>Today, Lemonade and I visited Studio Pansa Amstel, where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that&amp;rsquo;s so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is &amp;ldquo;dirty hands, clear mind&amp;rdquo;, and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.&#xA;I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker&amp;rsquo;s mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands.</description>

      <description>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of what the weather&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do in a given period of the year. After two weeks of cocooning, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block.</description>
