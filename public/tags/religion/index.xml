      <title>Eight of ten</title>

      <description>When I first set foot in the Old Catholic Church to attend an All Saints service, I knew I had found a special place. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.&#xA;It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times.</description>

      <title>All Saints Amsterdam</title>

      <description>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how new the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it&amp;rsquo;s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.&#xA;You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but fangirl.</description>

      <title>A believable truth</title>

      <description>I never get much reading done unless I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I&amp;rsquo;m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.&#xA;Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side.</description>

      <title>When Jesus sent out his Twelve</title>

      <description>This was written as part of Vine &amp;amp; Fig&amp;rsquo;s Sunday Scripture reflection project.&#xA;When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.&#xA;Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp;amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter.</description>

      <title>Of bridges and neighbors</title>
      <link>https://zinzy.website/2020/11/29/of-bridges-and-neighbors/</link>

      <description>When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”&#xA;When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp;amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics.</description>

      <title>Hell is other people</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people&amp;rsquo;s bodies.</description>

      <title>The benefit of discontent</title>

      <description>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:&#xA;Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — America Magazine&#xA;My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn&amp;rsquo;t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions.</description>

      <description>This was originally published as part of the Vine &amp;amp; Fig &amp;ldquo;Pray Tell&amp;rdquo; project.&#xA;She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‘Hey dear!’ it sounds. ‘Happy Mother’s Day&amp;rsquo;, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.&#xA;As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again.</description>

      <title>How to live for God</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard someone compare it to the relationship between a parent and a child. I imagine a child wanting to create a birthday card for his mother, opting to draw her portrait on the cover. Does that child draw a lifelike portrait of his mother? No, but it sure is endearing. I just want to draw the most beautiful portrait I can with the colors I got from my Mother.</description>
