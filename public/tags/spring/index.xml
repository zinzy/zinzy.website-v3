      <description>Nothing ungovernable, it&amp;rsquo;s more like a hum. The hum of I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling at my best, of can&amp;rsquo;t get that argument out of my head, of what if, what if, what if; a hum that I eventually forget is there at all, even though it never ceases to soundtrack my every move.</description>

      <description>Today I wondered:
Why do people start wars in a world that has pickles? How can I manage a single Google Calendar that has RSS feeds from multiple venues in Amsterdam?</description>

      <description>The procrastinating part of me celebrates these words.
I want a good calendar app. One I&amp;rsquo;m excited to use, that works across devices, and is happy with multiple accounts that didn&amp;rsquo;t all originate in its own ecosystem.</description>

      <description>How might we let users seamlessly manage calendars from multiple providers in one cross-device app that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel heavy, slow, and unreliable?</description>

      <description>They open their roti takeout, unfold their pancake, and start eating. Strike a pose, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to it. I ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s okay that I watch them eat before I start, so I can see how in the world I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to eat sauce without cutlery.</description>

      <description>Remember Flickr, and the way we self-published visual sneak peeks into our lives on that website, in the mid-zeroes? If we wanted a filter in our photo, we had to Photoshop it in there ourselves.</description>

      <description>My pastors have a way with words. Bible study on Thursday, and we use every pronoun but &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; reading Mark 6:1-13. &lt;em&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s just a carpenter — Mary’s girl. Who does she think she is?&lt;/em&gt; Give me a second, let me hear that again.</description>

      <description>Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say &lt;em&gt;I follow Jesus&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>Ever the snob I am, I made it one verse into Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s freshly-dropped &amp;ldquo;THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT&amp;rdquo; for saying out loud on the tram &amp;ldquo;no, I can&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;rdquo; before deserting my goal of listening to it in its entirety.</description>

      <description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t it one of God&amp;rsquo;s cruelest jokes, Manuele, our ability to feel imposter syndrome? When I read your post — late, obviously, because RSS feeds and I will never quite be best friends — I was struck by your openness on the matter.</description>

      <description>The March edition of the IndieWeb Carnival is about accessibility on the small web. The host, orchids, touches on a note-worthy design pattern found in this fine corner of the Internet: that of artsy, personal websites that emulate technology of old, particularly the early days of Internet.</description>

      <description>Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):
PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian You may want to download their Windows app If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes I think you may enjoy this article on PKM for researchers </description>
