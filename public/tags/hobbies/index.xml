      <description>Today, Lemonade and I visited Studio Pansa Amstel, where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that&amp;rsquo;s so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is &amp;ldquo;dirty hands, clear mind&amp;rdquo;, and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.&#xA;I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker&amp;rsquo;s mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands.</description>
