      <description>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We&amp;rsquo;ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so &amp;ldquo;dress for cold, hope for warmth&amp;rdquo; I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</description>

      <description>What is the deal with people and coffee? No, let&amp;rsquo;s try that again. What is the deal with people and dish water? Coffee1 these days. Is. Disgusting.&#xA;A Starbucks recently opened in Utrecht, and to celebrate the occassion, a dear friend of mine, whom I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in two years, suggested we meet there for a pumpkin spiced whatever.&#xA;Pat, I&amp;rsquo;d love to buy a middle finger. Or else perhaps just a question mark.</description>
