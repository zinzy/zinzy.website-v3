Here I am at the [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl) office, posing for an employer branding photoshoot. I usually don't use that whiteboard to draw anything, but that _is_ my desk in the background, and that smile is genuine. I gave a great talk at our periodic company update, and I feel I'm doing good work that helps the company reach its goals. It's a good day. The days have been good.

### Right now, I'm

- At home in Amsterdam's Indische Buurt, where I share a small shoebox with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) and [Lemonade](https://lemonade.waleson.us/). We are ~~childless~~ [child-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness) and enjoying every bit of it.
- Enjoying the alternation of sunny and rainy days
- Appreciating how the environment of Amsterdam allows me to meet new people almost everywhere I go
- Helping out at [All Saints](https://allsaintsamsterdam.church/) to make it the church I need it to be
- Working out again and loving it
- Making music in my spare time, and moving slowly as I set up my personal space for recording and writing
- Trying to bring my ideas and experiences into my writing more
