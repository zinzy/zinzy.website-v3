### How I listen
At the time of writing, January 2025, I have an active subscription to Spotify. Aware of the ethical and political considerations, I make daily use of the service, and use it as a central archive of the records I've listened to since the late eighties.

#### Discovering new music
I reject Spotify's AI strategy which takes the shape of "Made For You" playlists. Instead, I look for user-created playlists, usually by searching for `artist name` + `vibe`.

In addition, I enjoy reading the work of music critics, especially outside of their regular context of a magazine or other publication. Lastly, I enjoy how people like [Chris Glass](https://chrisglass.com/) and others feature songs they're listening to.

#### Listening to favorites

I treat user-created playlists as mixtapes users made for people like me. I'll listen for songs I like, and then go from there. Beyond that, my listening habits are **album-centered**, and not playlist-centered. I'm trying to make an effort to make music less decorative, so I tend to avoid playlists like "coffee house tunes" or "workout jams".

The repeat feature is set to `off` by default, making it so that I have to make a conscious choice about what to listen to next, and to give myself the reminder that I've listening to work created by a person, just like when I used to listen to physical records.

For each month and year, I create a mixtape playlist featuring my favorites from that period.
