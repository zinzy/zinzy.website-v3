Welcome to the garden; an ever-evolving, somewhat experimental section of this website. You may consider it a collection of working notes on concepts such as the [Miracle Morning](/miracle-morning/) routine, my spiritual [praxis](/praxis/), how [I'm child-free](/im-child-free/), how I think [tools do not matter](/tools-do-not-matter/), or my favorite spots in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam/).
