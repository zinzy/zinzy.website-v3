description: "The place I call home"

Since late 2015, Amsterdam has been the place I call home. I live on the East side, in a neighborhood called Indische Buurt, a multi-dimensional old school Amsterdam place with great coffee and even better hummus. There's much to say about what I love about Amsterdam.

### Favorite spots

There's always something fun to do in Amsterdam. My favorite restaurants, shops, museums, and other places are saved in [Zinzy's Amsterdam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XW41hpKBGK61449s8). If there's anything you think I should try out, [tell me](/hello/)!

### In Amsterdam, I'm one in a million

In Amsterdam (and Rotterdam), there's such a wide variety of people that I don't stand out. It's a stark contrast from how I grew up, and it's a privilege to which I won't quickly say goodbye. I often jokingly say that I love our neighborhood because Anja's the only white person on the bus. I suppose a childhood in the countryside means I'll forever require an environment that helps me overcompensate.
