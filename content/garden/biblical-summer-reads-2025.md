Hey firecracker! Below are three themes to accompany you during your time in France, or, in the words of our [lord and saviour Shakira, whenever wherever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weRHyjj34ZE).

What I've put together here is how I usually go about analysing any kind of text: by pulling in a wide variety of sources that seemingly have nothing to do with each other. It helps me compare and contrast, synthesise, and do something that I think you're already great at: walk around a room, look at what's in it, ask your child what _they_ think, and make up your mind about what it all means for _you_.

Good to know:

- Please consider this a museum visit
- I've added links to all texts as well as the Bible passages, two translations side by side: the one you use at church, as well as The Message Bible translation.
- You can't spell "The Message Bible" without spelling "mess", which is what it is. Think "youth pastor rapping at Christian summer camp". Still, it serves to remind us that no single translation is best.
- I hope you have a beautiful time resting, recharging, relaxing, cooking, tanning (SUNSCREEN!), and living your best life.

### Theme 1: "Christianity" as a practice of subversion

I love the Beatitudes because they show me Jesus in optima forma: the simple rhythm, the humanness of his imagery, the subversion, the "_you_ figure it out". _That_ is what keeps me showing up to learn from him. When I first "landed" in his spirituality, it was in reading Matthew 5:8: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God". Sanctimony and the evangelical tone of the word "pure" aside, something clicked that day: whenever I come up for air, when my ego rests for a moment, when distractions evaporate, that's where I can see the world for what it _really_ see it, God for what God really is. I was thinking about this last Sunday, sitting in your church, staring at those gold letters on the back wall. Here are a few things that I believe tie together the concept of subversion, which is why I call myself a student of Jesus.

#### A song:

- Which of the Beatitudes challenges you the most, why?
- Which verse of Andrea Gibson's poem helps you face that challenge?
- _The Uses of Not_ talks about the usefulness of things. What use do the Beatitudes have for you today?

### Theme 2: Prayer as a posture, not an appointment

It's easy for me to be a "kop zonder kip" in general, and within the context spirituality in particular. I often trick myself into thinking there's a "right" way to do Christianity, especially when I compare myself to others. It turns my practice into something that relies on logic, on conclusive statements backed up by Scripture. In these moments, it's helpful to remember that what I truly believe is that _the way is the destination_, that connecting with my surroundings can help me draw a deep breath, and that simple and gentle is best.

#### A song:

#### Prompts

- If you could give me two tips on how I can encounter God in a non-verbal way, what would you tell me?
- What is a thing you'd love to tell God off on?
- If you'd tell God "help, thanks, wow" today, what would you say?

### Theme 3: On showing up as we are

My biggest challenge within Christianity is showing up as I am in a world that often shows me I don't belong in Christianity. I sometimes feel like I'm passing for Christian, or passing for queer enough, passing for not-traumatised, or passing for not-Black. These texts often help me remember that I don't need any of that, that I have just as little real control over my circumstances as anyone else, and that just showing up is good enough.

Bible passages:

- [Psalm 139](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20139&version=NIV,MSG)
- [Ecclesiastes 9:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209%3A1-12&version=NRSVUE,MSG)

Reflections:

- [Notes on passing]() by Erin Clarke (that pastor I met in the streets of London)

Poetry:

- [The body never overreacts - it remembers](https://www.instagram.com/blackliturgies/p/DFGCFpUuCN1/?img_index=1) by Cole Arthur Riley
- [Enough](https://wordsfortheyear.com/2015/09/26/enough-by-david-whyte/) by David Whyte
