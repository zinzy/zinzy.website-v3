A standing invitation is an encouragement to seek contact with whoever extends it. It usually stays active for a longer period of time, sometimes decades. People use standing invitations to show people they appreciate contact requests from people they haven't met yet.

Depending on who we are and how many people see it, the standing invitation can be a source of stress. Writer and podcaster Patrick McKenzie has had a standing invitation on his website since 2012.[^1] As he notes at the top of the page, it has resulted in an overwhelm of people reaching out to him as his life's responsibilities changed. Anyone in the possession of a public standing invitation should, from the start, practice discernment in deciding when to respond to requests for contact.

Between 2018 - 2022, I had a standing invitation of sorts on my website in the form of a volunteering page, on which I listed the unpaid research and design efforts to which I had committed. Combining it with mentoring, which I had been doing for a few years, made me overpromise, and eventually, underdeliver.

My standing ovation still exists as a [hello page](/hello), although I'm quick to say "no" to things that don't spark my interest. I'm also on a mentoring hiatus.
