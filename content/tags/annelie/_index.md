Annelie and I met the way I've met most of my friends: because I'm a homo. She's not, but we met through a mutual friend. My friendship with Annelie is rare because I let her in where other people don't get to go. She has been with me through challenging times, never shying away from something that was uncomfortable or scary.

What I admire deeply about Annelie is the fact that she built her own company from scratch. She left a career in banking to be the change she wanted to see in the world: a specialist on diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging who actually _lives_ the challenges she seeks to solve.

Bonding with Annelie over lived experiences is easy. In addition, we have a shared love for what we call _planning hygge_, good food, and strolls in Oosterpark. Below is an overview of the appearances she has made on this website.
