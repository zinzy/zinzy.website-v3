On October 25, 2024 at the end of a seriously fun day out, I slipped and fractured my ankle in three places. Here's an overview of what happened after that, mostly for my own posterity.

### Friday, October 25, 2024
21:45 — I take a slight turn [behind the Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CHgs9ao4am34CVnBA) and fall. Two men stop and one calls the ambulance. Iris, a random passerby who happens to be a doctor, comforts me while we wait for the ambulance. I call Anja to tell her I've been in an accident, and that I'd like for her to come to OLVG West. 22:02 — The ambulance I'm in arrives at OLVG West. A few moments later, an x-ray confirms three fractures, one hairline. After administering local anesthesia and setting my ankle back in position, a nurse puts a cast on me.

02:15 — Anja and I arrive home. Later in the day, I'm [installed on the sofa](/2024/10/26/11/24/10/), where I spend the next few weeks when I'm not working. During the week, I'm back to my usual work schedule. I enjoy the [early birthday present](/2024/10/29/15/26/08/) I got myself the day of the accident. The anticoagulants are [giving me bruises](/2024/11/02/14/18/58/). I dream about [the future](/2024/11/04/15/55/00/).

I attend office hours at the casting department to check whether the swelling has gone down enough for surgery to happen tomorrow. The verdict: no. "Foot elevated" means my ankle is elevated above my ankle, which is elevated about my heart. 

### Monday, November 11, 2024
I'm back for office hours to get checked up ahead of surgery, and yay: the swelling looks good enough, and I'll come back in two days for surgery.

### Wednesday, November 13, 2024
Surgery goes well, and besides the nausea, recovering from it is smooth. To my surprise, I'm [off pain killers after only a few days](/2024/11/17/week-46-raw-dogging/). Not being able to bear any weight on my left leg starts to weigh on me, especially during the last stretch of the two weeks.

### Wednesday, November 27, 2024
As scheduled, [to my delight](/2024/11/27/09/07/51/), [the cast comes off](/2024/11/27/12/51/14/)! Learning to walk starts with a bit of hesitation, but soon enough I'm strutting across the house and through the neighborhood. [I'm back to work](/2024/12/01/week-48-two-feet/), and starting to feel like things are looking up again.

### Monday, December 16, 2024
My first time at the gym since the accident. Nothing in the world beats a good lat pulldown. Later, I call the plaster room to get my wounds checked out one more time before we leave for Paris, but the wait time is too long. Still, G., one of the plaster masters (my favorite job title) sees my missed call and returns it. We speak about an appointment tomorrow. She calls me back again, saying she doesn't trust what I'm telling her. One hour later, I'm at the hospital.

### Sunday, December 22, 2024
All that walking made it easier for my ankle to swell. I imagine that, combined with the lack of proper understanding of what it means to have open surgical wounds, made the whole thing go south. By now, my wounds are so infected that I may need more surgery. I spend the evening with Marcin and Allison watching that cool OJ documentary. [I'll hear more from the doctor tomorrow.](http://192.168.1.44:1313/2024/12/22/23/42/35/)

Tim helped me to the hospital yesterday, where things were clear: I definitely need more surgery. I have just enough time to [wrap up hosting the IndieWeb Carnival](/rounding-up-indieweb-carnival-december/) and to clean the house a little bit for when Anja and Lemonade come home from Paris. [And so it is](/2024/12/24/15/05/50/): I'm out of surgery and in the recovery room by 8:30 P.M., where I shout "JESUS" in pain so loudly and repeatedly that the surgeon asks me to calm down.

### Wednesday, December 25, 2024
The hospital room I'm in doesn't have a real view, but it does feel very tranquil. It's the temperature of [a botanical garden](/2024/12/25/05/32/31/). I spend seven calm nights there, next to [a woman who repulses me](/2025/01/04/week-1-hibernating/). [I draw on my iPad a lot.](/2025/01/03/painting-fjords/)

### Tuesday, December 31, 2024
Anja takes me home after a chaotic discharge filled with time pressure, waiting for medication, and making it home in time for the technical nurse to hook me back up to my antibiotics.
