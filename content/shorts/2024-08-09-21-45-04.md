What made [_American Fiction_ (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23561236/) such a delight to watch isn't so much the stellar acting or the clever writing, but Cord Jefferson's stunning ability to weave together irony and sincerity. It's not often that I see the nuance in smart, unstereotypical Black characters who are hilarious, and who at the same time fill my heart with tenderness.
