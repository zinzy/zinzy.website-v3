Said goodbye to Erik Vermeer yesterday. I've had a transformative experience working with him. "If you want to do something but you're scared, do it scared."

There's something endearing about the simplicity of being a man of quotes, especially since he's one of such complexity.

I gave him "Doppelg√§nger" (a misspelling I refuse to repeat). Into the endless mirror world, the perpetual, dialectic nuance, is where our conversations often led. Naomi's writing seems fitting. I hope I'll see him again.
