After adding myself to App Defaults I took the liberty of importing the available list of RSS feeds into my reader. It was a mistake. I spent the weekend pruning my subscriptions, hoping I won't be presented with 200+ updates a day in the form of micro blog content. A few of the new feeds immediately struck my fancy, though, among which was [Mandaris Moore](https://mandarismoore.com/), one of the few Black people I've come across on the IndieWeb. It's always good to see the African diaspora represented somewhere.
