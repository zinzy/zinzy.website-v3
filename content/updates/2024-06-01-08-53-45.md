As a design mentor, one of the things I encounter constantly is the stark difference between how some men and women speak of their own competencies. "May you be granted the confidence of a mediocre white man" is a phrase I utter at least twice a week. This morning, waiting for my local coffee spot to open, I saw a common occurrence of that level of confidence: somebody walked in before it opened, saying that, if undesired, the baristas would kick him out anyway. He returned three seconds later. I mused out loud, in front of him and two other friendly regulars who are themselves mediocre white men, that I was thinking about the thing I say to all my female and non-binary design mentees. I feel that my ability to do so in this social context proves that I, too, finally have the confidence of a mediocre white man. All this being said, though, I'm beginning to develop an appreciation for this alternative: "May you be granted the confidence of a disabled queer Muslim woman who, despite everything, dances in the rain."
