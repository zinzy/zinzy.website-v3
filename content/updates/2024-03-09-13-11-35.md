I'm intrigued by what's happening here. When I saw Sydney's red carpet look I thought of Billie Eilish's "coming out" as a bombshell. I wonder if a part of me is offended. I don't think so. I don't, by the way, think it's crazy that those far right articles celebrating Sydney's outfit as the end of woke were written by women.
