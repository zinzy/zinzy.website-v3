- Added [Updates](/updates) section, with pagination (using [StaticMania's solution](https://staticmania.com/blog/hugo-pagination)) and an [RSS feed](https://www.zinzy.website/updates/index.xml), using timestamp with `slugorfilename` notation for the permalink
- Updated [Start](/) page
- Added a [bookmarks](/bookmarks) page, which should probably become a bit sexier at some point
