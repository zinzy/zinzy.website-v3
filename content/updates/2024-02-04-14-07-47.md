Enjoying a cozy Sunday indoors with Lemonade. We took a long walk in the park, where we met Sammie, Maat, and Hovis and Norman. I can tell she's becoming a little less responsive to my cues, which tells me she'll be going into heat soon. I'm meeting Erin before Church. I gave myself a nice two-strand twist for the first time. Life is good.
