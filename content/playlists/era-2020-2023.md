When I think of the music I listened to in this period, I think of the way a bass sounds coming from a neighborhood garage. I never specifically sought out this type of music. Rather, I suppose there were just a lot of records produced in people's bedrooms, or sounding like they were.

There are sprinkles in there of why my Spotify listening profile places me in a queer hipster yuppie town, of the hopeful search for a spiritual home. And of course, there's the teenager in me who couldn't be pulled away from the guitar.
