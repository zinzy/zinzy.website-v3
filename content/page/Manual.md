Heya, I'm Zinzy! As a Product Designer I'm currently employed by [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl), an enterprise software provider in the Dutch healthcare space. I've been with them for a little over a year now, and consider this job to be a milestone in my career. I've always known I would one day venture into healthcare technology. I love its for its complexity, for the constraints of rules and regulations, and for the impact it can have on the working lives of busy people.

<!-- > If I came with a warning label, it would say: imagine Ted Lasso and the Law of Two Feet have a love child that periodically throws glitter in your face.

### Hello, I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene

### My role

I am a Product Designer, although some of our coworkers may call me a UX Designer, UX Researcher, or Interface Designer. The latter isn't my preferred job title, because it only covers part of what I do: I solve user problems through applied research and interaction and interface design.

### What's important to me

- `Strategy` I believe interface design alone can't accomplish greatness unless there's user-centered alignment across our entire company
- `Collaboration` I see great value in having close, mutually challenging relationships. Haven't met me yet, let's have coffee!
- `Inclusion` I'm a queer person of color and neurodivergent, and I appreciate work environments that give me autonomy to learn and deliver the way I know to do best, while making me feel part of the family

### My working hours
I'm on the `Europe/Amsterdam` timezone

### My availability

Working hours
: I usually start and finish anywhere between 07:00 and 18:00

Office time
: I spend one full day at the office, as well as at least two mornings or afternoons. This way, I get to see as many people in person as possible.

Time off
: I work 36 hours, which means I have one day off every two weeks. Usually that's on Monday, but it may vary

### Structure of my day

Check-ins
: I prefer to skip daily standups unless teamwork requires it
: If I do need to check in with one or more people, I prefer to do so between 08:00 and 10:00. This gives me time for deep work in the morning.

Breaks
: I reserve one hour for lunch between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. I don't take meetings during this time.

Meetings
: My one-on-one meetings last 30 minutes
: I generally will do my best to get out of group meetings that last longer than one hour.

### I do my very best work when

- I get to work in a multidisciplinary setting, building bridges between people and teams, and aligning closely with engineers
- I have the autonomy to work at my own speed
- I get to take ownership of solving problems I see or experience
- I can help facilitate a smooth development process by carrying out data-driven design in the right amount, at the right time

### I prefer communicating in these ways

- Slack: if you want to catch up, [skip the hello](https://nohello.net/en/) and instead just say so. If you need something from me, I'm happy to help. Make sure to give me some context of what you're looking for. If your message is time-sensitive, lead with that (e.g. "Contains time-sensitive request"). I enjoy asynchronous communication, because it helps me manage my inboxes
- Figma: any questions or feedback regarding specific designs are the perfect reason to write a Figma comment. It helps us document properly, but more importantly, it keeps the conversation going in a place where we can all see it.
- Video / Voice / Live: I'm often available for a huddle, especially if it pertains to time-sensitive work keeping engineers busy. Are we both at the office? Pull me aside, let's grab coffee. I like connecting with coworkers!
- Email: Here's a coming out moment, I detest email. If you need a paper trail, or if external people need to be involved, feel free to shoot me one.

### When receiving feedback...

- If you are able to and comfortable, give it to me face-to-face. I use cues from your tone, face, posture, and demeanor to contextualize what you're saying. It may help for me to ask some clarifying questions, too.
- The maxim [Praise in public, criticize in private](Praise%20in%20public,%20criticize%20in%20private.md) is important to me, particularly the latter part. If you have feedback about something I handled poorly or should stop doing, I prefer we speak about it one-on-one.

### What motivates me to come into work each day is ...

- At heart, I'm a problem solver. I love that I get to do this for a living
- I have a strong mission-driven work ethic, and I feel most comfortable at companies that do something that seeks to fundamentally address the things that make working life challenging for essential workers
- Having the ability to grow as a researcher and designer, as a coworker, and as a human

### I put boundaries in place between work and home in the following ways, please help me respect them…

I diligently use the 🤫 emoji on Slack to let my coworkers know I'm in focus mode. Other than that, when I'm not on Slack, I'm not at work. Please don't call me or text me about work matters outside of my working hours.

### When I’m stressed, the best way to support me is …

By asking me what I need. I struggle when people try to solve my problem, because it makes me feel I like autonomy, and I'm unable to explain my perspective accurately.
