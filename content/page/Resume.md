### In short
I'm a Product Designer with 17 years of experience making things for screens. Having gained experience across B2B and B2C, I spent the last decade specializing in softwar for people at work. Currently, I work in healthcare technology.

### Experience

#### Gerimedica (May 2023 â€” now)
We're a market leader in electronic health records in geriatric and handicapped care. I'm a proud UX team-of-one, and love digging into complex rules and regulations to find out how I can best support healthcare professionals in their day-to-day.
