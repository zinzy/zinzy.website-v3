My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, which sounds like ZIN-zee WHALE-son GREEN if you drop the R.

I am a [diary-keeper](archive), [designer](/work), and [crazy church lady](/praxis) celebrating the slices of life that propel me ever-forward. [This website](/colophon) is a quiet street on the Internet; a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I've been yelling at Internet clouds since [1997](/museum).

In [Amsterdam](/tags/amsterdam/) I share a shoebox with [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/) and [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55). Lemonade is a dog, but since we're a [child-free](/im-child-free/) home, she is my daughter. How did I get here? If you've never met my life partner, educator and potter Anja, you should. She's quite something.

I'm an [Afropean](/tags/being-afropean), [queer](/tags/queerdom), [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) first-generation University graduate. I have the immense privilege of waking up every day feeling 8+, with a labrador-like enthusiasm for life. It's an effective way to make up for [what wasn't](/2020/05/13/clobber/).

I'm a lifelong learner, music maker, song writer, photographer, doodler, reader, painter, gardener, and writer. I do my best to align what I do with [what I value](/values/). I [practice](/praxis) a "stop believing, start doing" kind of Christianity.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent, hailing from enslaved Angolan grandparents on one side, and a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks on the other. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. You may consider this website an extension of that. I'm an advocate for the [IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been [sober](/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/) since May 2018.
