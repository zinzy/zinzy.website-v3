I'm pleased you have reached my world wide web homepage. This is a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. No highlight reel, no likes, no follow button. You may [follow](/follow) me the old-fashioned way or, even better, [say hello](/hello).

### I'm one of those privileged people who wake up feeling 8+.

I get to surround myself with people in whom I see myself, I live in a beautiful home, and my career is a hobby I do during office hours. If you meet me in person, you'll see I like to laugh a lot. It's not fake, either. I'm just really thankful to be where I am today. I didn't have the easiest of starts, and it shows in who I am and how I write. Life truly is like a box of chocolates.

### I live and work in Amsterdam's Indische Buurt

For the past decade, I've shared my life with Anja, a high school English teacher. Last year, we welcomed home corgi Lemonade. We're a child-free family and couldn't be more pleased about it.

### I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent,

And come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany. I only began to feel a sense of belonging when I moved to Amsterdam. Its ability to help me recognize myself in the people around me will never seize to be a requirement for my living arrangements.

### I have an academic background in linguistics and theology

While I had great plans for myself academically, I have yet to decide how I'll spend my Master's degree becoming what I want to be when I grow up. I hold a degree in Literature and Linguistics from Utrecht University, and embarked on the VU University track to become a pastor.

Meanwhile, I had started a design practice in 2007 that, by now, is an enjoyable career in Information Technology. Academia has taught me most of what I know about reading and writing. It also taught me that everything is a text.

### Music has always played an important role in my life.

Like all my cousins and friends, I was enrolled in music classes from a very young age. Starting on the recorder, I eventually devoted myself to the trumpet, the oboe, and most other wind instruments found in your average local orchestra. In elementary school, I taught myself to play the guitar, which gave me access to a string of... string instruments. These days, you can often find me at the piano.

### I like chronicling my life in a diary

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been sober since May 2018.
