I share [my life](/biography) with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) and [Lemonade](/2024-08-11-15-21-22/) in Amsterdam.

[You can get in contact with me here](/hello).

I live with [unrelenting curiosity and intensity](/im-neurodivergent), and have been [yelling at Internet clouds](/museum) since 1997. I'm a linguist by trade, a seminary dropout by choice, a [designer](/work) by profession, a [mentor](/mentoring) by proclivity, a [bad developer](https://github.com/zinzy) by the grace of God, and a [community builder](/community) by moonlight.

[This website](/colophon) captures my interest in the IndieWeb, which is to say for in Internet that cherishes the small, the cozy, the open, and the individual. In reading it, you may learn about my [interests](/interests), [values](/values), and [praxis](/praxis).

If you'd like to show your appreciation, you may [buy me coffee](https://ko-fi.com/zinzy). If you don't know what to gift me for my birthday, try my [Goodreads wishlist](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/23204424?shelf=wishlist).
