Hello kind stranger, thank you for taking the time to visit my Internet home. This website is an online diary; a scavenger hunt of unfinished thoughts, polished ideas, and snapshots in various formats.

My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, which sounds like ZIN-zee WHALE-son GREEN if you drop the R. I live in [Amsterdam](/tags/amsterdam/) with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), and corgis [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/) and [Zev](/tags/zev/). My academic background is in comparative literature and theology, and I'm now approaching 20 years in Information Technology.

I am a person on a [mission](/mission), with various [interests](/interests/), [ideas](/ideas/), and [values](/values/). I absolutely love receiving friendly emails from Internet strangers. Here's a standing invitation to [say hello](/hello). I've been yelling at Internet clouds since [1997](/museum) and have a crush on the intimate and personal Internet, and [I'm not the only one](/blogroll). You?

I'm an [Afropean](/tags/being-afropean), [queer](/tags/queerdom), [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) first-generation University graduate. I have the immense privilege of waking up every day feeling 8+, with a labrador-like enthusiasm for life. It's an effective way to make up for [what wasn't](/2020/05/13/clobber/).

I'm a lifelong learner, music maker, song writer, photographer, doodler, reader, painter, gardener, and writer. I do my best to align what I do with [what I value](/values/). I [practice](/praxis) a "stop believing, start doing" kind of Jesus following.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent, hailing from enslaved Angolan grandparents on one side, and a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks on the other. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. You may consider this website an extension of that. I'm an advocate for the [IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. Had I come out a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene. You're welcome.

I've been [sober](/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/) since May 2018.
