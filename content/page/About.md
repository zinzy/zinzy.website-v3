Hello, I am Zinzy Waleson Geene. I'm a diary-keeper, community builder, and designer celebrating the slices of life that propel me ever-forward. I have a crush on the cozy, intimate, and personal Internet. This quiet street on the Web is a testament to that. It is a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I've been yelling at Internet clouds since [1997](/museum). 

### Home
I'm an Afropean, queer, [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) person committed to tuning and sharing my [yes space](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0192/). I am alive in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam/), where I share a shoebox with corgi [Lemonade](/2024/08/11/15/21/31/) and my life partner, educator and potter [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

I'm an [orthoprax Christian](/praxis), a music maker, a budding antiracist, an embroiderer, a doodler, IndieWeb nerd, a reader, a gardener, and a lifelong learner. My purpose in life is using what I've been given and turning it into something lighter, better, healthier, more hopeful.

### Work
I'm a product designer of 17 years, currently working in health tech. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work, often working on dinosaur software and deeply complex workflows. You're invited to learn more about [what I do for a living](/work). Rather than a portfolio, this website is about who I am, wholly.

My academic background is in media analysis, linguistics, and theology. Long ago, I dreamed of a career as a published author or a minister building a progressive church. Some part of me is still plotting to attend seminary at some point. I feel fortunate that my time in university has so firmly shaped my worldview around the stories we tell ourselves and each other. A lot of what I think and read about deals, in one way or another, with such stories, especially the ones making up [the silly archive](https://www.trikster.net/1/halberstam/1.html).

I love spontaneous emails, so [say hello](/hello/).
