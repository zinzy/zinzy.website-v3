I’m a diary-keeper, researcher, designer, and community builder living and working in Amsterdam. Thank you for taking the time to visit my home on the Internet. This website is an online diary; a scavenger hunt of unfinished thoughts, polished ideas, and snapshots in various formats.

I taught myself to build websites as a child in the late nineties and have made an effort — in varying degrees of commitment, skill, and intensity — to share slices of my life on the web ever since. I believe in an Internet that is whimsical, creative, honest, and expansive.

I live in [Amsterdam](/tags/amsterdam/) with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/) and [Zev](/tags/zev/). I'm an [Afropean](/tags/being-afropean), [queer](/tags/queerdom), [sober](/tags/sobriety/), [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) first-generation University graduate. I have the immense privilege of waking up every day feeling 8+, with a labrador-like enthusiasm for life, not in spite but _because_ of [what wasn't](/2020/05/13/clobber/).

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent, hailing from enslaved Angolan grandparents on one side, and a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks on the other. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. Had I come out a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene. You're welcome.

My time in University centred around comparative literature and theology, and to this day, everything is a text to me. Eventually, I found my way to fun and challenge in Information Technology as a user researcher and software designer.

I'm currently on a path that seems to be leading me away from a focus on software design, and more towards design and research operations. I don't know what that means for me just yet. Luckily, my current place of work is a beautiful way to explore it.
