I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene, a diarist, reader, and community builder celebrating the slices of life that propel me ever-forward. I have been yelling at Internet clouds [since 1997](/museum/). I am deeply enamored with the cozy, intimate, personal Internet. Thank you for visiting this website.

For the past 17 years my career has been in design. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work, currently working in healthcare technology. You're invited to learn more about [what I do for a living](/work). Rather than a portfolio, this website is about who I am, wholly.

My academic background is in linguistics, cultural analysis and theology. Long ago, I dreamed of a career as a published author or a minister building a progressive church. Some part of me is still plotting to attend seminary at some point. I feel fortunate that my time in university has so firmly shaped my worldview around the stories we tell ourselves and each other.

A lot of what I think and read about deals, in one way or another, with ontology, spiritual [praxis](/praxis/) and discernment, and [the silly archive](https://www.trikster.net/1/halberstam/1.html). I enjoy writing and making music, photography, and hiking. I'm currently deeply invested in piano practice.

A long-time spiritual nomad, I'm thankful to have found [All Saints Amsterdam](https://allsaintsamsterdam.church/), a radically inclusive Christian fellowship of people seeking to comfort their afflictions and afflict their comfort. I find immense meaning in listening to Jesus as if he meant what he said. Since 2023, I serve on All Saints' board as Director of Communications.

I'm an Afropean, queer, [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) person living in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam/). There, I share a shoebox with corgi [Lemonade](/2024/08/11/15/21/31/) and my life partner, English teacher [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

I love spontaneous emails, so [say hello](/hello/).
