Hey Internet stranger! I'm Zinzy. Thank you for taking the time to visit this space on the Internet. Imagine how much you've had to slow down from the infinity of social media timelines to even make it here. I have a crush on the cozy, intimate, and personal Internet, and [I'm not the only one](/blogroll). You?

My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, which sounds like ZIN-zee WHALE-son GREEN if you drop the R. I am a diary-keeper, designer, and [crazy church lady](/praxis) celebrating the slices of life that propel me ever-forward. Much of it you'll find on this quiet street on the Web; a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I've been yelling at Internet clouds since [1997](/museum).

### Home

I'm an Afropean, queer, [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) person committed to tuning and sharing my [yes space](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0192/). I am alive in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam/), where I share a shoebox with corgi [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/) and my life partner, educator and potter [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

I'm an [orthoprax Christian](/praxis) (much more fun than it sounds, I promise), a music maker, a budding antiracist, an amateur photographer, a doodler, IndieWeb nerd, a reader, a gardener, and a lifelong learner. My purpose in life is using what I've been given and turning it into something lighter, better, healthier, more hopeful.

### Work

I'm a designer of 18 years, currently working in health tech. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work, often working on dinosaur software and deeply complex workflows. You're invited to learn more about [what I do for a living](/work). Rather than a portfolio, this website is about who I am, wholly.

My academic background is in media analysis, linguistics, and theology. Long ago, I dreamed of a career in academia, as a published author, or as a minister building a progressive church. I feel fortunate that my time in university has so firmly shaped my worldview around the stories we tell ourselves and each other. A lot of what I think and read about deals, in one way or another, with such stories, especially the ones making up [the silly archive](https://www.trikster.net/1/halberstam/1.html).

I love spontaneous emails, so [say hello](/hello/).
