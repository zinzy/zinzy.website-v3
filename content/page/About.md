Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene and this is my personal website; a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.

I believe firmly in the values of showing up fully, all intricacies and nuances included. This is not a professional design portfolio, nor is it a space that details just my personal life. There's no highlight reel, no likes, no follow button (although you can subscribe to [my RSS feed](/follow)).

If you meet me in person, you'll see I like to laugh a lot. It's not fake, either. I'm just pleased to be where I am today. Ever since I was a child, I expected my mid-thirties to bring peace, clarity, and a reduction in fucks given. I was right. I'm looking forward to my mid-fifties.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent and come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the country, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany. Being neurodivergent, queer, and a person of color meant I only began to feel a sense of belonging when I moved to Amsterdam. Its ability to help me recognize myself in the people around me will never seize to be a requirement for my living arrangements.

While I had great plans for myself academically, I have yet to decide how I'll spend my Master's degree becoming what I want to be when I grow up. I studied Modern Lit and Linguistics at Utrecht University, and embarked on the VU University track to become a pastor. Meanwhile, I had started a design practice in 2007 that, by now, is an enjoyable career in Information Technology. Academia has taught me most of what I know about reading and writing. It also taught me that everything is a text.

Music has always played an important role in my life. Like all my cousins and friends, I was enrolled in music classes from a very young age. Starting on the recorder, I eventually devoted myself to the trumpet, the oboe, and most other wind instruments found in your average local orchestra. In elementary school, I taught myself to play the guitar, which gave me access to a string of... string instruments. These days, you can often find me at the piano.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.
 
My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been sober since May 2018.
