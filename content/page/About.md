Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene (she/they) and this is my personal website; a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. It’s a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. On this website as well as in life, I aim to bring my whole self: the self that [works](/work), plays, questions, doodles, fears, cooks, prays, gets angry, changes her mind.

As you can see, I like to laugh a lot.

It's not fake, either. I'm just pleased to be where I am. Ever since I was a child, I expected my mid-thirties to bring peace, clarity, and a reduction in fucks given. I'm pleased to say I was right. I'm looking forward to my mid-fifties.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent and come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the country, where both Germany and Belgium are a short bike ride away.

As a [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent) queer child of color, I came to being in the margins. I suspect that Amsterdam's ability to help me recognize myself in the people around me will never seize to be a requirement for my living arrangements.

But like I said, love is great, work is great, life is great.

Looking back, the road I travelled seems entirely natural, even IF it felt anything but. I was a _stacker_ in school, a term the Dutch use to refer to people who climb the ladder of our tiered educational system. both primary and secondary school were not the best fit for me, although I spent my childhood feeling like I was just _thinking_ wrong.

Eventually, in my early twenties, I made it to Utrecht University, where I studied Literature and Linguistics. I ran an absurdist student magazine, explored the many corners of the Humanities, and founded my own design studio in the process. After embarking on the theology track for a while, I eventually found myself in a front end team lead role, which would lay the foundation for a career in technology.

While I had great plans for myself academically, I never ended up getting that master's degree. I think I'm saving it for divinity school after all. Academia taught me so much of what I know about reading critically, writing dynamically, and looking at texts through many different sets of glasses. It also taught me that everything is a text.

Music has always played an important role in my life. Like all my cousins and friends, I was enrolled in music classes from a very young age. Starting on the recorder, I eventually devoted myself to the trumpet, the oboe, and most other wind instruments found in your average local orchestra. In elementary school, I taught myself to play the guitar, which gave me access to a string of... string instruments. These days, you can often find me at the piano.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.
 
My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa.

I've been sober since May 2018.
