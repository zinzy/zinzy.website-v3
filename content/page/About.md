Hello kind stranger, thank you for taking the time to visit this space on the Internet. I have a crush on the cozy, intimate, and personal Internet, and [I'm not the only one](/blogroll). You?

This website is an online notebook; a scavenger hunt of unfinished thoughts, polished ideas, and snapshots in various formats. I absolutely love receiving friendly emails from Internet strangers. Here's a standing invitation to [say hello](/hello).

My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, which sounds like ZIN-zee WHALE-son GREEN if you drop the R. Some things about me:

- I am a diary-keeper [(archive)](/archive)
- I love my work as a [software designer](/work)
- I'm a [crazy church lady](/praxis)
- I live in [Amsterdam](/tags/amsterdam/) with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) and [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/)
- I keep a [website](/colophon) because I like the independent web

I'm an [Afropean](/tags/being-afropean), [queer](/tags/queerdom), [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) first-generation University graduate. I have the immense privilege of waking up every day feeling 8+, with a labrador-like enthusiasm for life. It's an effective way to make up for [what wasn't](/2020/05/13/clobber/).

I'm a lifelong learner, music maker, song writer, photographer, doodler, reader, painter, gardener, and writer. I do my best to align what I do with [what I value](/values/). I [practice](/praxis) a "stop believing, start doing" kind of Jesus following.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent, hailing from enslaved Angolan grandparents on one side, and a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks on the other. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. You may consider this website an extension of that. I'm an advocate for the [IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been [sober](/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/) since May 2018.
