Hey Internet stranger! I'm Zinzy. Thank you for taking the time to visit this space on the Internet. Imagine how much you've had to slow down from the infinity of social media timelines to even make it here. I have a crush on the cozy, intimate, and personal Internet, and [I'm not the only one](/blogroll). You?

My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, which sounds like ZIN-zee WHALE-son GREEN if you drop the R.

I am a diary-keeper, designer, and [crazy church lady](/praxis) celebrating the slices of life that propel me ever-forward. Much of it you'll find on this quiet street on the Web; a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I've been yelling at Internet clouds since [1997](/museum).

I'm an Afropean, queer, [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) person tuning and sharing my [yes space](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0192/). I am alive in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam/), where I share a shoebox with corgi [Lemonade](/tags/lemonade/) and my life partner, educator and potter [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

I'm a lifelong learner, music maker, song writer, photographer, doodler, reader, gardener, and an advocate for the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I do my best to align what I do with [what I value](/values/). I [practice](/praxis) a "stop believing, start doing" kind of Christianity.

I'm a designer of 18 years, currently working in health tech. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work, often working on dinosaur software, deeply complex workflows, and development processes that lack users' voices. This website isn't about that, but you're invited to learn more about [what I do for a living](/work).

My academic background is in comparative media analysis, linguistics, and theology. Long ago, I dreamed of a career in academia, as a published author, or as a minister building a progressive church. Luckily, I'm great at failure. Nevertheless, I appreciate the central notion I take away from my academic training, which is that stories are the invisible fabric of life, the driver, the gel, the magic.

I love spontaneous emails, so [say hello](/hello/).
