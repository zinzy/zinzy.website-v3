Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene. This is my personal website. I believe firmly in the practice of showing up in fullness; nuances and flaws included.

This website is a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. No highlight reel, no likes, no follow button. You may [follow](/follow) me the old-fashioned way or, even better, [say hello](/hello).

### In short

I am what some may consider an edge case: African bicultural, neurodivergent, queer, non-binary, following Jesus, and a survivor of adverse childhood experiences. It shows in some of the things you read here.

If you meet me in person, you'll see I like to laugh a lot. It's not fake, either. I'm just thankful to be where I am today. I live and work in Amsterdam, and share my life and a petit garden with Anja and Lemonade. We live in the city's finest: de Indische Buurt.

### In long

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent and come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

I only began to feel a sense of belonging when I moved to Amsterdam. Its ability to help me recognize myself in the people around me will never seize to be a requirement for my living arrangements.

While I had great plans for myself academically, I have yet to decide how I'll spend my Master's degree becoming what I want to be when I grow up. I hold a degree in Literature and Linguistics from Utrecht University, and embarked on the VU University track to become a pastor.

Meanwhile, I had started a design practice in 2007 that, by now, is an enjoyable career in Information Technology. Academia has taught me most of what I know about reading and writing. It also taught me that everything is a text.

Music has always played an important role in my life. Like all my cousins and friends, I was enrolled in music classes from a very young age. Starting on the recorder, I eventually devoted myself to the trumpet, the oboe, and most other wind instruments found in your average local orchestra. In elementary school, I taught myself to play the guitar, which gave me access to a string of... string instruments. These days, you can often find me at the piano.

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been sober since May 2018.
