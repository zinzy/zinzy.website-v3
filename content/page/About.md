I'm pleased you have reached my [world wide web homepage](/site). This is a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. No highlight reel, no likes, no follow button. Just my appreciation for the web, [my excessive curiousity](/im-neurodivergent), and the words I choose to make sense of it all.

### I'm a Product Designer of 17 years, specialized in making software for people at work.

I taught myself to build websites in elementary school in the late nineties, and began working from my one-person design studio when I turned 18. I had entirely different plans for my future, but in the meantime, I've found a very satisfying home in Information Technology.

I've worked as a designer, researcher, strategist, product manager, and design manager. Right now, I'm living the dream at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl). If you'd like to learn more about the type of work I'm doing at the moment, please visit [Work & Play](/work-and-play).

I hold a B.A. in Linguistics & Literature from Utrecht University, and dropped out of Theological Seminary after a year of being the only queer Black person there. I think I'm still saving my Master's degree for Divinity School.

### I practice gratitude, and seek to go to bed more content and smarter than I woke up.

I'm one of those privileged people who wake up feeling 8+. I get to surround myself with people in whom I see myself, I live in a beautiful home, and my career is a hobby I do during office hours.

If you meet me in person, you'll see I like to laugh a lot. It's not fake, either. I'm just really thankful to be where I am today. I didn't have the easiest of starts, and it shows in who I am and how I write. Life _is_ like a box of chocolates.

### I live and work in Amsterdam, where I share my life with Anja and Lemonade.

Lemonade is a dog, but since we're a [child-free](/im-child-free) home I consider Lemonade my daughter. I kind of hate that about myself. If you've never met [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55?pvs=74), you should. She's quite something.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent, and come from a long line of loud, burgundian band geeks. I grew up in the narrow tail-end of the Netherlands, bike rides away from both Belgium and Germany.

Being a [Black](/tags/being-black), [lesbian](/tags/queerdom), [non-binary](/2021/03/25/call-me-she-but-not-woman/), [neurodivergent](/im-neurodivergent/) person with a history of [adverse childhood experiences](/2020/05/13/clobber/) hasn't always been an easy life path, but luckily I began to feel a sense of belonging when I moved to Amsterdam.

### I like chronicling my life in a diary

In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little kid. You may consider this website an extension of that. I'm an advocate for the [IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. If I had been a boy, you would've had to call me Stevie Wonder Waleson Geene.

I've been [sober](/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/) since May 2018.
