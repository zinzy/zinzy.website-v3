### 1997 - 2002: Local dev env

Before I ever managed to publish anything on the actual Internet, I found out about HTML, and how it helped me structure pages to tell exactly the story I wanted to tell. One may call it reminiscent of [Creed's blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYsMPiQNixU).

### 2002 - 2003: HTML profiles

The introduction of CU.nl ushered in the Dutch infancy of Web 2.0. For me, it meant connecting with peers and strangers, and building a complete website in an HTML-supported user profile.

### 2003 - 2004: .tk all the way

In the Netherlands. `.tk` domains were all the rage in high school. Some of my classmates had one to bully others, meanwhile, I had my own Shania Twain fan page.

### 2004 - 2006: Freewebs, free, but in English

On a variety of Freewebs accounts, I wrote a blog, nurtured my Shania Twain mania, and began to experiment with photography.

### 2006: DoYouLikeMyTightSweater.com

Named for the [debut album of my favorite band at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Like_My_Tight_Sweater%3F), this domain was gifted to me by my old friend [Titus](www.tituspowell.com). It made me feel cool enough, finally, to get involved in the international blogging community.

### 2006 - 2009: Photography blog

First under DoYouLike, and later under many other names, I published a photo diary that chronicled my personal life as well as the start of a modest career as a freelance photographer.

In addition, I began to seriously invest in my online presence as a web designer and website maker.

### 2009 - 2015: ü§åüèΩ I'm a writer, you know?

Me matriculating as a Humanities undergraduate at Utrecht University meant I began taking myself Very Seriously. Like many of my peers, I dreamed of becoming a writer, and I made my blog play the part.

Looking back, of course, I cringe relentlessly at who I was back then. In the meantime, my work as an independent web designer continued.

### 2015 - now: Don't take yourself too seriously

Having transitioned from running my own design studio to working in-house at technology companies, my online presence required less of a focus on my work, which has left much room for exploration.

With a strong focus on IndieWeb principles, I've spent the past decade on various domains, writing about the small slices that make up my life.
