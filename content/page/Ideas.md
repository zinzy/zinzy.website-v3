- I want an easy way to know what's going on around me, without having to get sucked into some branded events app vortex. I want it to know about the niche events that are not on Meetup.
- I want to have a harp, an oboe, a violin, a bass, an electric guitar.
- I want to do a silent retreat.
- What does it take to be a really good potter?
- When's the best time to go see the Nortern Lights?
- How can design dynamically position itself as a service within an organization?
- How can technology aid collaboration, inclusion, and knowledge building?
- How does storytelling affect the lived experience and notion of self of individuals?
- How can I learn to play that piece of music?
- How does neurodiversity affect my relationships, attention, and productivity?
- How can I cook this better?
