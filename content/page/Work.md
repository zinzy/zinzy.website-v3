description: I'm a designer, a mentor, and a community builder

I'm 17 years into a career in Information Technology. When I tell people I have an academic background in literary criticism and theology, it never fails to surprise them. For me, the analogies between reading a text, designing software, and designing shared spaces are myriad.

- **Paying _very_ close attention:** I read, watch, and listen closely to the way people express themselves and engage with each other

- **Creative problem-solving:** I'm a lateral thinker looking for opportunities and constraints, and I seek to challenge myself and others directly, and care personally

- **I have a knack for research:** Perpetually satisfying my deep curiosity, I research text _and_ experiences to get the full picture, make up my mind, and make better decisions.

- **Meeting people where they are:** Being inclusive, empathic, and trauma-informed is [an important value](/values) for me. It helps me form close connections, facilitate conversations, and move projects forward
