I research, design, and sometimes develop digital tools for people at work. I've been making a living in Information Technology for the past 18 years. When I tell people I have an academic background in literary criticism and theology, it never fails to surprise them. For me, the analogies between reading a text, designing software, and designing shared spaces are myriad.

- **Paying _very_ close attention:** I read, watch, and listen closely to the way people express themselves and engage with each other

- **Creative problem-solving:** I'm a lateral thinker looking for opportunities and constraints, and I seek to challenge myself and others directly, and care personally

- **I have a knack for research:** Perpetually satisfying my deep curiosity, I research text _and_ experiences to get the full picture, make up my mind, and make better decisions

- **Meeting people where they are:** Being inclusive, empathic, and trauma-informed is [an important value](/values/) for me. It helps me form close connections, facilitate conversations, and move projects forward

- **Story as a vantage point**: I start anything I do with the awareness that the narratives we cultivate in our heads and in our relationships are the invisible fabric of life
