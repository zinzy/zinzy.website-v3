I'm a User Experience (UX) practitioner. That's a jargon-y way of saying I design software and research how user-friendly it is. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work.

For the past 17 years, I've worked as a researcher, developer, designer, design manager, and product manager in technology companies across a variety of industries. I take a Ted Lasso approach to my work: I care little about my job title, and a lot about whatever activity will help us solve problems more effectively.

### Gerimedica (2023 — now)
As their senior UX researcher and designer, I enable Gerimedica's product department in building user-friendly solutions for our market leading multidisciplinary healthcare software.

### Leeruniek (2020 — 2023)
First as a UX strategist, and later as a Design & Product Manager, I helped streamline workflows at this startup, and built and scaled their interdisciplinary research practice

### Airtrade (2015 — 2020)
As their first designer (though truly I started there as a front-end lead), I established a UX process at this travel technology market leader, building a multi-brand design system for a dozen of white labels tools in our product suite.

### Studio Zinzy (2007 — 2015)
In my one-person studio I designed and built websites and software for clients large and small; from churches to healthcare professionals, and fine artists to publications.
