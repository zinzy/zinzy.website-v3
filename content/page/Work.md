I'm a User Experience (UX) practitioner. That's a jargon-y way of saying I design software and research how user-friendly it is. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work.

Since 2007, I've worked as a researcher, developer, designer, strategist, design manager, and product manager in technology companies across a variety of industries. I'm strategic in my perspective, and tactical in my day-to-day. Whatever I do, I do _just enough_ of it to solve a problem.

### In my last 360 review, what stood out in coworker feedback were

- My high standards, professionalism, and rapid production pace
- The bridge I provide between business and technology
- My ability to make the difficult easy to understand
- My critical and creative perspective
- The sense that I meet people where they are, and the warmth and humor people experience in our encounters

### I work as a Senior Product Researcher and Designer at Gerimedica,

A provider of healthcare software. Rather than specialize in a particular business domain, I see the commonalities across these domains, and apply best practices accordingly.

I love business-to-business software because of its intricate business rules, serious problems, and domain experts. Healthcare technology is, by far, the most complex domain I've worked in, and I couldn't be happier.
