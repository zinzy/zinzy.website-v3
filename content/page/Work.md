I'm a User Experience (UX) practitioner. That's a jargon-y way of saying I design software and research how user-friendly it is. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work.

For the past 17 years, I've worked as a researcher, developer, designer, strategist, design manager, and product manager in technology companies across a variety of industries. I'm strategic in my perspective, and tactical in my day-to-day. Whatever I do, I do just enough of it to solve a problem.

### In my last 360 review,
What stood out in coworker feedback were my high standards and professionalism, rapid production pace, the bridge I provide between business and technology, my ability to make the difficult easy to understand, my critical and creative perspective, the sense that I meet people where they are, and the warmth and humor they experience in our encounters.

### I make tools for people at work
I work as a Senior Product Researcher and Designer at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl/), a provider of healthcare software. Rather than specializing in a particular business domain, I'm trained in seeing the commonalities across these domains, and applying best practices accordingly. I love business-to-business software because of its intricate business rules, serious problems, and domain experts.

### Gerimedica (2023 — now)
As their senior UX researcher and designer, I enable Gerimedica's product department in building user-friendly solutions for our market leading multidisciplinary healthcare software.

### Leeruniek (2020 — 2023)
First as a UX strategist, and later as a Design & Product Manager, I helped streamline workflows at this startup, and built and scaled their interdisciplinary research practice

### Airtrade (2015 — 2020)
As their first designer (though truly I started there as a front-end lead), I established a UX process at this travel technology market leader, building a multi-brand design system for a dozen of white labels tools in our product suite.

### Studio Zinzy (2007 — 2015)
In my one-person studio I designed and built websites and software for clients large and small; from churches to healthcare professionals, and fine artists to publications.
