### What do you mean "reader of choice"?
My favorite thing to do on the Internet is visit other people's personal websites and read about how they're experiencing life. I appreciate not only what and how they write, but also how they lay those words out on a page. Some websites are slick, others have barely any custom styling. The variety of it all is what I admire.

The easiest way to stay updated on what all those people are doing, however, is not visiting all of their websites individually. I've tried. It's much easier to collect all of their updates in a single environment, and go from there. Many of us do this using an RSS reader. [Learn more about feeds and RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/). I personally enjoy using [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) for my RSS needs.
