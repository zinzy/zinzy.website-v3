description: A personal manifesto about the relationship between this website and artificial intelligence
sidenote: "I think manifestos are kinda bougie. Still, this is my [AI manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto)."

We Dutch people have a nice saying: the soup is not eaten as hot as it is served. There are scary things, but we're mostly okay. I actually like using AI at work. It improves my brevity. I also like it in my personal life; I talk at it on my bike ride home. [It just calms you down after wanting to take a wrench to someone's side mirror in traffic](https://abbottelementary.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Bulb/Transcript).

### Nevertheless,
Not a word on this website was written using artificial intelligence, unless explicitly stated.

### Why I keep AI out of my writing
Writing is about more than the words it produces. Those who vehemently disagree engage in acts of pollution.
