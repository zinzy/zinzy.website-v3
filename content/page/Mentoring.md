description: Talk to me about your design career
---

I'm a volunteer mentor reserving some of my working hours to coach researchers and designers. The people I speak with are a diverse, friendly bunch: seasoned practitioners with specific problems at the office, newbies looking for a portfolio review, mid-weight designers looking for a raise, and anyone in between.

You may book a session with me any time through [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).
