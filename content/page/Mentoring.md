### Book a session

I love speaking with people from all around the world about what it means to research and design digital products. Whether you're new to the industry or you've been around the block a few times, I'd love to learn more about your story. You can find me on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).

### Before you book 
While I keep my session inbox open to anyone, I've noticed lately that there are more requests than I can manage. I may direct your request to another mentor, resources, or one of the guides below.

### How do I actually organize a research project?
Research is all about moving from assumptions and unknowingness to a state of knowing just enough to unblock a project. When you begin planning your research, don't start with the method. Instead, start with the questions you need an answer to. Are they the right questions? What type of data should you collect to answer them? To get started on this journey, which happens to be my favorite, read UserInterviews.com's [Field Guide](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide).
