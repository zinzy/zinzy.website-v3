---

This is a personal website.

I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. No "hey guys welcome back to my vlog", no Instagram highlight reels. The sense of whimsy, coziness, and a beautiful lack of information overload are highs I have been chasing ever since.

The Web 1.0 has instilled in me a deep appreciation for a small-scale, intimate, and friendly Internet made up of hand-crafted websites. This is one of them. I’ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

I generally don't know people visit this space unless they tell me. The most humbling response I've received about my website to date comes from the wonderful [Simone Silverstroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/), who shared the following quote in his [_People & Blogs_ interview](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-simone-silvestroni):

> Zinzy Waleson Geene has a website that's a constant source of curiosity. She alters the look, changes typography, structure, navigation so often that following through RSS isn't enough. When I see a new post, I go check the website.
