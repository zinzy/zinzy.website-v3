### Everything's a text

I was trained in literary and cultural criticism in an environment that was slowly developing the sensibility to look beyond Serious Literatureâ„¢. These days, even though I'm nowhere near academic criticism of any kind, I still find myself discovering layers and layers of meaning in whatever I read, see, hear, encounter, experience, especially in the mundane. It means I'm almost never bored, but also that I should expect the odd puzzled look every now and then.

### Intersectionality
We all stand at an intersection that makes us perfectly and uniquely us. Some of the roads on that intersection denote that we share experiences or perspectives with other people, even if it means we're never quite a copy of them. With this knowledge I approach everyone around me, having a keen interest in what the various identities can do for or withold from a person.

### Belonging

I have intimate and ongoing experience with feeling like I don't fit in anywhere, and it's important to me to do whatever's within my power to prevent others from having similar experiences. People who feel like they belong are happier, more empathic, more productive, and most importantly healthier. I seek to be antiracist, trauma-informed, queer-inclusive, and attuned to the people around me.

### Intentionality

While it's a value, intentionality also remains a major challenge in my life. Sticking my head in the sand was a skill I adopted at a young age. These days, I do my best to be aware of what stories my body and brain tell me, and what intentions I have to guide the way I care for them.

### The golden rule

The great Talmudic sage Hillel was once approached by a gentile who was willing to accept Judaism only if Hillel would teach the Torah while the prospective convert stood on one foot. Hillel's lesson? "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. This is the whole of the Torah; the rest is commentary. Now go and study it!" I have made a tattoo of it.
