Perhaps it is my ["Christian"](/praxis) heritage, but I am not scared of big words like suffering and sin. I _am_ scared, however, of the rigid hyperbole of the personal mission statement. Mine came to me the way people come to the idea for their first tattoo: suddenly, epiphanically, inevitably.

<!-- In everything I do, I seem to be forever trying to figure out whether things are as they should or shouldn't be. It's not a conscious effort; rather, it's a desire to satisfy a primal need: to have things be good, safe, comfortable. There's a deep psychology behind it. Not for the Internet. -->

I use "suffering" broadly, lightly, profoundly; in reference to the physical, emotional, social, financial, intellectual, the spiritual. Suffering is Gaza, is living through antisemitism, is the anger holding together the manosphere. Suffering is intergenerational racial trauma, is being stuck, is the FOMO experienced by a middle school tween.

"Suffering" is a question I ask: should I comfort my afflictions, or afflict my comfort? Should I counter the hurt I see, or find a way to look it in the face? A daily repetition that applies to the inane as much as it does to the profound. 

I like this mission because it's a never-ending story. The journey is the purpose, the means are the end.

<!-- I've always found mission statements to be the weird flavour you get if you mix [that family mission statement episode of _Sister Wives_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceK0riM8jkM) with whatever productivity method podcast bros are raving about on the Internet: unnecessarily hyperbolic. I suppose my relationship with them is the one I have had with tattoos. For the longest time, I found it ludicrous that people knew of any image or word that was so important they'd carry it for life. -->
