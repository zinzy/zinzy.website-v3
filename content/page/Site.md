description: About this website
---

I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. The sense of whimsy, coziness, and a beautiful lack of information overload are highs I have been chasing ever since. The Web 1.0 has instilled in me a deep appreciation for a small-scale, intimate, and friendly Internet made up of hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

### "What do you do here?"
This is the only website I have; it details my personal as well as my professional interests and endeavors. With it, I celebrate my vulnerability, lack of awareness, and change of heart. It consists mostly of English language text, as well as images produced by myself.

### "Why does this site look... unfinished?"
I don't know when you're reading this, but chances are that, when you do, this website looks unusual in one way or another. As a designer, my days are made up of making decisions that benefit both the people who use my creations and the people who pay me to make them. On this website, all bets are off. I happen to love the way plain text looks against a white canvas.

### If that wasn't technical enough

- After almost a decade with Jekyll, I recently migrated this website to the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I like [HTML energy](https://html.energy/), but I also like conserving my writing across many different technologies, apps, and frameworks. Static site generators let me write in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and keep all of it in a single folder.
- It lives in a private repo on [Github](https://github.com/zinzy), and is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- It makes use of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), browser-native typography, and little else
- I write my private and public notes in a single folder on my computer, and collect publicly available notes in a Github repo
- Currently, the software I use for writing is Obsidian, and I update the notes repo using [Obsidian Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher)
- It uses [h-card and h-entry IndieWeb standards](https://spec.indieweb.org/)
