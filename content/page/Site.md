description: About this website
---

I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. The sense of whimsy, coziness, and a beautiful lack of information overload are highs I have been chasing ever since. The Web 1.0 has instilled in me a deep appreciation for a small-scale, intimate, and friendly Internet made up of hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

### Principles
- This is a [motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [A website is a room](https://a-website-is-a-room.net/)
- [A website is a home](https://nicochilla.com/my-website-as-a-home/)
- This one follows [brutalist web design principles](https://brutalist-web.design/) 
- It is [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- It will hopefully one day be properly [accessible](accessibility)
- I like to keep things simple, unlike how we [experience the web today](https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/)

### What I put on here
- I have one website detailing my personal and professional interests and endeavors
- This space accepts my vulnerability, lack of awareness, and change of heart
- It consists mostly of English language text

### "Why does this site look... unfinished?"
I don't know when you're reading this, but chances are that, when you do, this website looks unusual in one way or another. As a designer, my days are made up of making decisions that benefit both the people who use my creations and the people who pay me to make them. On this website, all bets are off. I happen to love the way Times New Roman in blue looks against a white canvas.

### Technical details
- After almost a decade with Jekyll, I recently migrated this website to the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I like [HTML energy](https://html.energy/), but I also like conserving my writing across many different technologies, apps, and frameworks 
- It lives in a private repo on [Github](https://github.com/zinzy), and is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- It makes use of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- I write my private and public notes in a single folder on my computer, and collect publicly available notes in a Github repo 
- Currently, the software I use for writing is Obsidian, and I update the notes repo using [Obsidian Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher)
- [Yellow Lab Tools](https://yellowlab.tools/result/got2ipv3ap) gives this site a 100/100 global score
- This website is a proud member of the [250kb club](https://250kb.club/zinzy-website/)
- This website is [hosted green](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzinzy.website) has been designed to minimise the energy consumption and CO2 emissions that result from navigating the Internet. Current emissions are available to view on [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/zinzy-website/).
- It uses [webmention, h-card, and h-entry IndieWeb standards](https://spec.indieweb.org/)
