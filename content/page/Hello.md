title: Hello
description: How to reach me
---

This is my [hello](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/) page, where you can learn how I like to keep in touch. If you have something to share, you'd like to play or learn together, or can think of any other reason we should be talking, get in touch with me. That is a [standing invitation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/).

### Other ways of contacting me

- Email: `hello` + this domain
- [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy) is also acceptable, although it may take months
- [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/zinzy) is good for work
- ~~If you'd like to schedule mentor time with me, please do so via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene)~~ I'm not mentoring at the moment
- I do not use social media. Any account in my name that you may find is not in use, so feel safe assuming I won't see your message, and I won't receive a notification of it.

### Good to know

If you'd like to show your appreciation, you may [buy me coffee](https://ko-fi.com/zinzy). If you don't know what to gift me for my birthday, try my [Goodreads wishlist](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/23204424?shelf=wishlist).
