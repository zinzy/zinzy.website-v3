It's difficult to describe how loud the birds are against the dark dark blue sky across the street from the hospital, and even more difficult to convey the dread I feel as I hear their poop splatter on the floor, but it's very easy to say what it means to walk on two feet again, even if it's with crutches and the occasional pain: the attitude is gratitude.
