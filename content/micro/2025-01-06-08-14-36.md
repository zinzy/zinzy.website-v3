As I settle back in at home, I'm slowly shaking off the fear of germs that enveloped me at the hospital. It means getting to pet Lemonade again, who cuddles her way into my heart more deeply every day. It's interesting to see what it does to me, our wordless relationship. 

As Anja and I planned another Paris trip to use my unused train tickets, we got into a little argument about whether or not to take the dog. Anja says this is what we signed up for. I say a _real_ vacation is when I don't have three walks around which to plan my days. But then again, with a face like this, will I ever need a vacation?
