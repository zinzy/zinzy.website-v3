All Saints celebrating its homecoming service today. Warm, long hugs, even with the heat, delicious potluck, new faces, whispering children during communion, reading a passage out loud and being struck by its depth. Who knew the first chapter of James is where I need to be? It's a good time for church to start back up again.
