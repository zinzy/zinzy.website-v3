Tired as I, too, am of the American elections, the American friends half-joking about moving to Amsterdam, my mind keeps gravitating around various questions. How do the stock exchange and political elections compare? What would happen if polling and reporting on the election were not allowed? What political philosophy could I read about the life of voting imitating the art of polling? With headlines such as ["the county that got every president right"](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000009787486/the-county-that-got-every-president-right-since-1980.html), do Americans feel the discomfort I feel about the idea that a vote can be right or wrong, that it's a national guessing game? Are we going to be okay after this?
