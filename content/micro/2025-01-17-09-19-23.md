Due to forgetful manoeuvring on my part, I find myself off work for the next three Fridays. Having spent two lovely days at the office this week, I can tell that's a good thing. I'm happy, but tired. Thankful, but tired. Challenged, but tired. Today's the day I'll finally tidy up all the medical supplies that have been scattered around the house since late October.

Sterile gauze, pain killers, an ear thermometer, a dozen boxes of antibiotics, cotton pads, hospital documents, paper bags serving as portable trash bins, and adhesive bandages bandages bandages. One recurring thought has been that I'm so privileged to even be in the position to buy the number of island dressings that I did. That and all the cab rides to the hospital. "Let's get one thing straight," said the surgeon on Monday, "you and those bandages are done. Go home."

It all feels like another paragraph into a new chapter I'm calling "On the Up and Up". Wounds become scars, standing showers become normal, takeout deliveries become an exception, wheelchairs become dispensable, supplies become clutter, hearts become calm.
