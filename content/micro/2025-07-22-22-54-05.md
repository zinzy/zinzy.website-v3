Dogs, I've learnt, have a majestic ability to recover after trauma. Zev just fell her equivalent of five stories to the floor, and after deep howling, shaking it off multiple times, cuddles, a near-instant nap, and a wee she is prancing around the living room as though nothing happened. I want to be her when I grow up.
