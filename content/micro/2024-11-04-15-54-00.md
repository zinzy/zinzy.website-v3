I'm one week into my broken ankle recovery journey, and so far, things are quite alright. I'm not in a lot of pain, and I can manage my way around the house with a new set of crutches and a wheelchair (covered by insurance). There are a few questions that are on my mind:

- How does surgery feel?
- When I walk normally again for the first time, will my feeling of relief be as potent as I imagine it will be if I were to suddenly regain my ability to walk right now?
- When I have surgery on Thursday, how easily will it be for me to develop a dependence on opiates?
