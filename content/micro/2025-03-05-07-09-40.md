The 2025 Lenten season and I are off to a beautiful start. I'm trying something new this year: I don't want to focus on a habit I want to quit, co-opting Lent to dive into productivity/diet/whatever culture. Instead, I'm looking forward to identify a few of my common thinking traps, and learn how I can move beyond them to what I consider the less circumstantial, more profound beliefs I have about life. A gorgeous morning sky is making it all quite the treat.
