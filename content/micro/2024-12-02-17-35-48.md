> (...) But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.
> â€” [Genesis 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%202%3A17&version=NRSVUE)

One thing that has been on my mind for a few days now is: if Adam didn't know the difference between good and evil, why was dying bad?
