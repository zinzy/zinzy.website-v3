A recent rediscovery has been 4850, a little cafe behind the hospital. It used to be Michelin-awarded fine dining, now's it a coffee place and wine bar. During the week, they close at 3, but on Fridays, they're open until 6. The team working there have such a great dynamic, and it's fun to crack jokes with them. Perfect way to start the weekend.
