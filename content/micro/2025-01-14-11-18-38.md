My first time traveling to the office without taxi assistance since my accident. I'm excited to see everyone, and nervous about how tight these hiking shoes feel. I've worn the right one plenty of times, but I'm breaking in the left one only now. I keep thinking "what if my leg explodes?!" but then I remember what the surgeon said during yesterday's check-up: "you no longer have an ankle problem, only a head problem."
