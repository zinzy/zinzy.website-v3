For this week's weeknotes I'm trying something new with sections, inspired by [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/29/weeknotes-nov-23-29-2024/). Overall, week 48 was great: I had a few important wins in the health department, and overall I leave it feeling confident, optimistic, and loved.

### Three wins

1. After 34 days, I retired my cast and got an aircast!
2. I'm finally able to learn to walk on two feet again
3. I've been enjoying my [Miracle Morning](/miracle-morning/) routine

### Stuff I did

- 8 hours on both Thursday and Friday confirmed what I had hoped: I finally feel energetic and proactive enough to get back to work.
- Organized my workload to get reacquainted: what was I doing? Why do I care about this company? Why do I care about my coworkers? A nice [Get Well Soon card](/2024/12/01/indieweb-carnival-impact/) helped tremendously.
- Began planning for a little getaway to Paris with Anja and Lemonade.
- Finished writing my letter to Mathilde, which had been a long time coming.
- Ordered a muzzle and foldable travel crate for Lemonade.
- Ordered the New Zealand Prayer Book.

### Consumed

- Doing my best to get in four Bible chapters a day.
- Started reading a chapter a day of _Live with Intentionality_ as part of my morning routine. Feel weird about the fact that it's self-published by someone unknown to the Internet. It's a helpful, concise read, though.
- Trying to exchange reading the news for reading IndieWeb RSS feeds in the morning.

### Learned

- Soporific (adjective): sleep-inducing (from [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/opinion/jake-paul-mike-tyson-fight.html?searchResultPosition=1))
- That, if sleep-deprived enough, I'll find myself becoming a boxing specialist overnight as I watch the hours and hours leading up to the soporific match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson.
- Many people mistake narwhals for unicorns, despite their vastly varying physiques.

### Appreciated

- The [rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hIMsd6BlQ) of "Bread and Roses" in the movie _Pride_.
- The [rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd_tTIs5yME) of "The Age of Worry" by Madison Cunningham.
- Anja for taking stellar care of me all the while stating clearly what she needs for herself.
