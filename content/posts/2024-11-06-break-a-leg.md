At the end of October Marcin and I went to see _[Mr. K](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7972570/)_, a confusing but no less beautiful and interesting story of a man in a hotel. If Lars von Trier made _House of Leaves_, I thought on my bike ride home. I couldn't figure out who the guy in the movie was. My mouth dry from the dim sum seasoning. I supposed I've always known, but I'd forgotten how smooth and slippery the cobblestones behind the Palace are until I slipped and fractured my ankle in three places.

We Dutch people like to complain about our healthcare system a lot, but the time it took before I was in the ER, the ease with which I got the right treatment, and the handy wheelchair covered by insurance remind me of our privilege. Marty McFly's dad, that's who that guy in the movie was, I thought in the ambulance.
