I'd already gotten into the habit of _doing_ less, of _consuming_ less, and I feel it prepared me for the state in which I find myself. In a cast, whether with crutches or in a wheelchair, things take four times longer because I'm required to break a task down to its actions. Getting up to put a plate in the dishwasher is a five-minute event. Unlike most other times in my life, I don't feel overcome by impatience. Instead, I
