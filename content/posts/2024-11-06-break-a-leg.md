Marcin and I go to see _[Mr. K](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7972570/)_, a confusing but no less beautiful and interesting story of a man in a hotel. If Lars von Trier made _House of Leaves_, I think on my bike ride home. If only I could figure out who the guy in the movie was.

My mouth dry from the dim sum seasoning, the late October streets so unusually warm I go home without my coat on. I suppose I've always known, but I'd forgotten how smooth and slippery the cobblestones behind the Palace are until I slip and fracture my ankle in three places.

We Dutch people like to complain about our healthcare system. Still, between the ambulance arrival time, the treatment in the ER, the convenient wheelchair, and the fact that I won't get a bill for any of it reminds me we're a privileged bunch. Marty McFly's dad, that's who that guy in the movie was, I remember in the ambulance. Never lost his boyish charm.

They are three clean fractures, one hairline at that. I keep saying this to justify the absence of pain whenever my coworkers tell me about the free death wish they received with their broken ankles. At home, I wheel around the house with a smile on my face, cooking dinner, unloading the dishwasher, attending Anja's graduation ceremony.

A few weeks in, there are a few lessons I've learnt.

### Slow down
It's astounding how long things take when I can only use one leg. It's even more astounding to see the things my leg can carry. Tasks I now break down to their molecular actions. I kept hearing and seeing "slow down" all through October. I like to think this was in preparation for this experience.

### Then slow down some more
As is not seldom the case with me, I took on this challenge with an excess of enthusiasm. This made it easy to continue working and feeling autonomous in the house. It also meant that I wasn't keeping my foot up high enough for the swelling to go down. With my surgery postponed one week, I find myself recalibrating. How long will the cast be on? Will I be in a walker when I'm in Paris? How "up" is _up_?

### Go further, once you're there: further
For the past few months, I've struggled with finding time for myself to sit and do nothing, unbothered. I kept thinking that I couldn't hold more than I was holding at the moment. Breaking my ankle propelled me forward, to a space where I marvel at how much they can be, the things I carry. It goes the other way around, too. Every time I think my leg is as relaxed as it'll be, there's more relaxation, just like I learn in yin yoga.
