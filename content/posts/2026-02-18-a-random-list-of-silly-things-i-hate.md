Thank you for unintentionally inviting me into a blogger challenge, [Steve](https://tangiblelife.net/a-random-list-of-silly-things-i-hate). Giving my [nope](/nope) page a break, here is a random list of silly things I hate right now.

1. How it feels when Anja sees me journal on my iPad in bed
2. How YouTube envelopes me in an embarrassing amount of brain rot
3. How the shoes I bought on Vinted didn't fit at all
4. How I can't figure out what produces the dishwasher error despite varous attempts at solving the issue
5. That the house smells like onions even if it did result in an enormous amount of delicious onion confit
6. That I have to pay for films on Apple TV, for which I am already paying
7. That our indoor plant game is off this season
8. That we painted our wall pink
9. That my glasses never _really_ get clean anymore
10. That I don't have a single, perfect, unified app for quantified self stuff

### Not so silly

1. Toxic wokeness
2. Witnissing the delight White people take in me speaking with them about toxic wokeness
