### Three wins

1. Gave a successful presentation during a company-wide meeting, and it prompted the responses and follow-ups I had aimed for
2. Took my first walk to the nearby park with friends who returned from a month-long holiday
3. Went to Sunday's church service without crutches for the first time since the accident

### Stuff I did
Spending a few full days at the office is my new normal, although Anja and I soon learned that one of the weekdays will require me to be at home half of the day. Lemonade was home alone for a little too long, so I took her out to the pet store for extra treats and a new toy. At work, I continued to work on my professional goals, as well as a presentation to help coworkers and teams see the connection between my goals and our company goals.

On Monday, I learned that my weak shoulder and chest muscles have been greatly impacted by my use of crutches these past few months, and that all of this contributed to the development of an overworked, protesting elbow muscle. The physical therapy saga continues.

### Consumed
It's always fun to keep a straight face while telling people Anja's aunt worked on _Twin Peaks_, _Homeland_, and now _Zero Days_, which is quite a treat to watch. I had hoped February would bring a nice opportunity to read a little more, but who am I kidding?

### Purchased
Here's a sad one. Sitting on the bus, I happened to spot on one of its monitors that De Balie was celebrating International Women's Weekend with Roxane Gay. The idea that Anja and I could be in the same room with this brilliant, brilliant person makes me mouth breath a little bit. €42,50 well spent on two tickets. Sadly, Roxane's mother passed away recently. A horrible time for her, and a disappointed one for us. Snacks and toy for Lemonade made for €50,47. Public transport and taxi rides came to €70,57, mostly because I spent €32,04 getting to and home from church.

### Appreciated
I was off on Friday, and my films of art house theatres, walks in the neighborhood had to make room for tinkering on my brand-new [guestbook](/guestbook). I don't use analytics, and if people don't email me through my website's contact form, I have no idea they're reading. I saw a few people pop up in the guestbook that I hadn't met, or that I didn't expect to be reading my website. Fun!

### Wondered
What's a good guide for Lent 2025? Where does the term "pray tell" come from? What's a good, more accessible alternative to Proton? How can I set an auto reply on WhatsApp? Who is Lutz Ebersdorf? What's a steel glass door called? What's OKLCH? 

### Something to improve
Promising myself less about the near future.
