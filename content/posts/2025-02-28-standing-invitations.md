An enjoyable part of my day job is that I get to hyper-segment healthcare professionals into neat groups based on age, personality types, gender, educational level, tech-savviness, and behavioral patterns. I believe fervently that data can do good, which is: help healthcare professionals practice their _craft_ and not spend 35% of their time on the menial tasks that make up the administrative part of their job. I love that my employer is as excited about data as I am, and that I get to geek out with dashboards and spreadsheets to help development teams make better decisions.

At home, though, it's a different story. One of the things I like most about my website is that I don't know you've been here unless you tell me. I stopped using analytics tooling on my personal website a long time ago, and I like it that way.

For a few years now I've had an [open invitation](/open-invitation) to [say hello](/hello). It has been providing me with friendly conversations with Internet strangers for years. It's pleasant when some random guy from the American Midwest emails me to ask how my ankle is doing. Using the contact form on my hello page, it's pretty easy to get in touch with me.

I'm very pleased to announce that there is now yet another way for you to let me know you've been here. It's by signing my brand-new [guestbook](/guestbook)! I love seeing what people write on a website maker's public wall, and I hope my page will slowly fill up with nice words from all over the world.

See you there?
