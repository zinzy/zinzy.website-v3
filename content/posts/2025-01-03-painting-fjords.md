I've finally fallen in love with drawing on my iPad. During my stay at the hospital, I had so little to do that I eventually began doodling, exploring brushes, and mixing methods.

I'm surprised by how easy it is to learn how colors work, at least on a digital canvas. Below is an overview of four images of fjords I made. It's easier for me to get the colors right when I'm working with a photograph, I've found.

December 28 — I made this from memory, thinking back to our [2023 summer in Norway](/2023/08/17/norway-et-al/). Colors are harsh, and the whole thing looks like I'm trying to hard to get into art school without knowing what I'm doing.

December 29 — "I think I should start with a beige canvas instead of a white one", I thought here. Slightly better, but still not anything I'd put on the Internet with pride.

December 30 — "Maybe the streaks don't all need to be at a perfect 90 degrees?" I figured. The mountains in the back make me think of a Scientology leaflet.

December 30 — I'm quite proud of this. I love the soft colors, and I believe the snow on the farthest mountain could be mistaken for that in a photograph, if one were to be looking at it with eyes half closed, for only half a second.

As with everything I do only once, half-baked, without much effort, I've now declared myself a professional artist.
