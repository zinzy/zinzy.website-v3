_I wrote this as part of this month's IndieWeb Carnival, which is [hosted by V.H. Belvadi](https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-friction) and centers on friction. The biggest lesson I've drawn from real life about the value of friction lies at the six-week point of my three-month antibiotics protocol._

The Web 2.0 as we know it today was designed the way antibiotics are: with great expectations and overzealous fury.

Antibiotics can give us a terrible case of diarrhea the way [Instagram can give us eating disorders](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugens-senate-testimony/story?id=80419357): it's not a bug, people, it's a feature. Antibiotics simply seek to kill bacteria. Meta teams simply seek to remove friction.

Any bacteria, the good and the bad.

Any _friction_, the good and the bad.

I was at the office yesterday. By now you might be sick of hearing it, but I [fractured my ankle and got a fracture-related infection](/tags/broken-ankle/), so I haven't been there a whole lot. One week at the hospital, two surgeries, and three months later, here I am again. My ankle is feeling stronger, I'm less fatigued, and I miss my favorite [second place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). I have six more weeks of antibiotics to go. I'm halfway there.

I started the day cofacilitating a user interview with one of our product owners. We met online with a social worker to assess this new feature we're rolling out. As always, we learned a lot. "It works well," the social worker said, "but it's way less effective than your competitor's feature. See, I work for various organizations and they all use different patient record systems, so I see the difference every day."

The friction this user was describing, the annoyance leading to longer screen time, is a problem I'm eager to solve. After all, our company's creed — a phrase that's difficult to translate — is: "meer bezig met je vak". For our non-Dutch coworkers, I always translate this to the less catchy:

Healthcare professionals should be allowed to carry out their _profession_, not just do their _job_. 

This purpose is what brought me to healthcare technology in the first place. The complex domain, intricate workflows, and outdated software is what excites me most about this industry. I'm fascinated by figuring out how I can help professionals spend less time in the software I make so they can focus more on the work they really want to do.

The longer I'm here, the more intimate my relationship with friction becomes.

Big Tech, much like antibiotics, doesn't understand the art of nuance. And

I was at the office yesterday. By now you might be sick of hearing it, but I [fractured my ankle and got a fracture-related infection](/tags/broken-ankle/), so I haven't been at the office a lot. Two surgeries, a week at the hospital, an intravenous take-home IV drip, and three months later, here I am again. My ankle is feeling stronger, I'm less fatigued, and I miss the wonderful [second place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) that the office is for me. 

I started the day cofacilitating a user interview with one of our product owners. We're new to collaborating this way, the product owner and I, and I love showing them around the wonderful world of user experience research. We met online with a social worker to assess this new feature we're rolling out, and we learned a lot.

 

At the office, our creed is something that we're still figuring out how to translate properly: "Meer bezig met je vak".

What we're saying here is: healthcare professionals should be allowed to focus on carrying out _their profession_. Interacting with patients and improving their lives is more important than peripheral tasks such as administrative work and having to deal with poorly-designed software.

> Healthcare professionals should be allowed to carry out their _profession_, not just do their _job_. 

What I love about this phrase, and I use it almost daily, is that it reminds me why I'm here, at work to make things better. As yesterday's conversation with the social worker showed me: there are decisions I make, that my fellow designers make, that my coworkers make, that add friction to a workflow in a place where it doesn't make anything better.

Of course, outside, in the real world, we all know the tale. More friction is good. As beautifully illustrated by [the Fogg Behavior Model](https://dovetail.com/outlier/foggs-model/), less friction equals more conversion and engagement. This is the philosophy that built Big Tech, that threatens to fundamentally change the way we engage with each other and the world. We're all trying to get out from under it. All the reasons we have for oppossing the reality it brought are rightful. 

The more I think about friction, though, it feels like the wrong problem or solution to solve for.

When I was readmitted to the hospital, the dramatic day of Christmas Eve, an elderly woman was also checking in next to me. An inguinal hernia, quick surgery, and within moments she has been started on antibiotics. She was a kind-spirited, sweet old lady, but I hated every second of being next to her.

Aside from her missing dentures and the inexplicable gurgles that came out of her mouth, she has explosive green-colored diarrhea. I knew this because its remnants could be recognized any time I went to the bathroom. Anyone who has ever taken antibiotics will know that they're designed to be so aggressive that they aim to kill every kind of bacteria they come across. The good ones, and the bad.

The woman was completely miserable throughout her entire stay, and I'm sure the antibiotics and her ensuing bowel movements had everything to do with it. Antibiotics were to the woman what Instagram was to those teenagers who all developed eating disorders because of all the diet culture doom scrolling.

Removing all friction in the consumer Internet economy of today will inevitably result in unbearable diarrhea in one way or another, as long as tech companies keep treating the Internet the way they have.

But friction isn't all good. 




 Today, thinking of friction, I realize bacteria are to the woman at the hospital, in all her regretful nastiness, is essentially what Instagram is to all those teenagers who n









When I boil it down to its delightful [brunost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost) core, the central question of my working life is: is this good friction?





My work life is full of friction, and I love it that way.

In design and research, my time spent with users is all about friction. "This new feature works well, but it works much less effectively than when I carry out the same task in your competitor's tool." There's friction in the user experience, and friction in the way people talk about it. It works well but it really doesn't. I now have to spend more time at my desk.





Once I got to the office, a successful refinement reminded me of how design is everyone's job, not just mine. To top it off, another product owner gave a great overview of what we will be working on this year, and what we won't. It left me feeling inspired and motivated. At the end of the day, we all huddled around the bar to say goodbye to one of the most talented and opinionated engineers with whom I've had the pleasure of working.
