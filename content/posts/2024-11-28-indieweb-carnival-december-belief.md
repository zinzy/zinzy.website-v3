As we approach the end of 2024 (wow, already?!) I'm pleased to do something I have been anticipating for months: host the December 2024 edition of the IndieWeb Carnival ([What is that?](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival)).

### The theme is belief

It's an open theme, one that I hope will inspire you to share whatever pops into your head when you think about it. A few prompts to merely inspire you:

- What is something you can't _know_, but that you believe?
- What's something you wish you could _unbelieve_?
- How do you relate to the word "belief"?

### Guidelines

1. Submit in English or any language open to online translation tools
2. Submit in any medium as long as it produces a single URL
3. Send it to me on or before December 31, 2024
4. Use the email address zinzy {at} pm {.} me and the subject "IndieWeb Carnival on Belief"

As always, I need some time to digest this theme myself. ~~A link to my post will appear on this page. I'll publish a round-up post of submissions on January 1, 2025.~~ I was able to quickly jot down some thoughts of my own while [compiling the list](/2024/12/24/rounding-up-indieweb-carnival-december/) of submissions right before I went in for a week-long hospital stay.

Thank you in advance for participating. I'm looking forward to learning from your perspective!
