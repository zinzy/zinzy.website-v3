[Last year](/2023/07/22/what-pride-means-to-me-in-2023/) I wrote about how a friend, a coworker, and another friend attended the annual Pride Walk. This year, I don't know what to attend.

There are two walks, one is called a March. Ironically, that's the one that's not the progressive one. The other Walk made the news because its main organizer had to pull out after pro-Palestinian but inappropriate comments about Israel.

A polio epidemic has broken out in Gaza.

People are mad at Bella Hadid for wearing the wrong sneakers.

What in the god-abandoned _Fight Club_ are we doing?

Pride is a good milemarker for me because it shows me, year after year that I'm slowly turning into an actual boomer.

I don't need to see a Pride flag in every single street of Amsterdam.

If we keep adding more and more things to the Pride flag, ten years from now it'll just be a pitch black rectangle.

A brown and black triangle on a piece of cloth doesn't make my white gay friends easier to relax with; it doesn't increase their commitment to antiracism. I've found it's _yet another_ cancel threat that keeps people from doing actual homework.

I don't need the Olympics opening to be one giant tribute to the mall version of _Rupaul's Drag Race_, which, in itself is already a mall version of _actual_ ballroom and drag culture.

Drag is not the only available or acceptable expression of queerdom.

Pride Amsterdam, Queer Pride, Queer & Pride Amsterdam. I can't decide what I hate more: how difficult we're making it _for ourselves_ to be more inclusive, or the fact that Queer & Pride Amsterdam does not make any grammatical sense.
