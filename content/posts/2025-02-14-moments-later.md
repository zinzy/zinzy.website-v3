I dreamed I added my profile picture to an IndieWeb directory. Upon visiting the website in question, I noticed how my initial difficulty to correctly operate my phone's photo library had resulted in two pictures. The first one showed my face, and the second did, too. Scrolling down, though, any viewer would immediately be met with my bare chest. I panicked, and thought about people who fall victim to revenge porn. "Would my pictures be eligible for removal", I wondered, "even if I was the one who committed the act?" I spent the rest of the saga stressed and horrified. Moments later, I wake up to Valentine's Day, fully clothed.
