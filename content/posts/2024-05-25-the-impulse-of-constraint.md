[The May edition of the IndieWeb Carnival](https://hamatti.org/posts/indie-web-carnival-may-2024-creative-environments/) is all about creative environments. Where do I create? When does it work, and where could I tweak my experience?

Here I am.

"Imagine our product owner needs user data on how we should implement a particular new feature in our business-to-business software. How would you go about conducting research?" I asked a full lecture hall of freshmen anthropologists at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/bachelor/cultural-anthropology-and-development-sociology). After a few minutes of blank stares, one brave student answered me.

"I would want to observe how people do their jobs. Let's say a week per person, and at least three to five people. Then I'd need a few weeks to analyze and synthesize the data. So all in all, only two to three months?" Hope and mild proud in her voice at her new-found ability to negotiate for her skills in a business context.

"That's beautiful!" I went, "we need it by the end of the week."

Artist and TED speaker Phil Hansen once remarked:

> If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.

I wouldn't be able to work as a product designer if there were no such thing as practical constraints. The idea of limitless green fields and blue skies has plagued me in many a whiteboard challenge prep. When I think of creative environments, I think about the mental environments most conducive to my creation process.

### Mental environment 1: the to do list

There's never a dull moment as a UX team of one. Right now, there are 38 different things that require my active participation, attention, and proactiveness. They fall into broad categories: feature design, research, facilitation, design system, UX deliverables, metrics, mentoring, growth. Some are urgent, others important. Each of these projects falls in one of the four boxes of the Eisenhower matrix.

The environment in which I find myself becomes creative when I make space for thinking, play, failure, and spontaneity. I've mapped my to do list to the Eisenhower value quadrants.

I can handle all of these things because I take a moment each day what requires my attention and what doesn't. It may have taken 20 years since I first read _Getting Things Done_ but I now understand what it means to have a mind like water.

The water isn't an ocean, per se. It's more like a properly sized fjord. I donm't swim in it forever, but I designate at least one stretch of time per day to float in it. If I close my eyes, the water feels endless.
