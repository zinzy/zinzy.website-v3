The procrastinating part of me celebrates these words.

I want a good calendar app. One I'm excited to use, that works across devices, and is happy with multiple accounts that didn't all originate in its own ecosystem. I want it to be lightweight.

I want a beautiful way of organizing my areas of responsibility. The difference between organizing my objectives, and executing on them is growing larger by the day, it seems. I don't see people around me who appear to have the same struggle.

I want a lunchbox that doesn't leak, break or get messy. I want it to cost less than it does.

I want an ice cube maker that only dispenses if the temperature is higher than 25 degrees Celsius.

I want stuff for a good dirty chai.

I want the lights of our living room plant tower to be on the same light management system as our other lights.

I want to know all the keyboard shortcuts to all apps I use without having to learn them.

I want to read _everything_ without having to use my eyes or having to pay for it.
