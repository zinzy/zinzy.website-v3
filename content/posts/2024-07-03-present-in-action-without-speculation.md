My pastors have a way with words. Bible study on Thursday, and we use every pronoun but _he_ reading Mark 6:1-13. *She's just a carpenter — Mary’s girl. We’ve known her since she was a kid. (...) Who does she think she is?* Give me a second, let me hear that again. 

I know a biblical story has come alive when I feel my ancestors stand up behind me. Sometimes they feel like a hand on my shoulder. Perhaps a nod I see without turning around. Reading the Bible to the hums of a thousand perspectives. 

On Thursday, Mark 6 sounds like a whole choir. 

I bet Jesus understood exactly who he was. A barely describable thread of red that held him together.

I'm reading _None of the Above_, a delight about the intersection of being non-binary and Black. Travis Alabanza knows what they're talking about, because they're talking about who they are. 

In the precision of the writing, I learn they struggle with exactly that. Not knowing. Their not-knowing is a force field. It can delegitimize, bring doubt where the skin is already a bit too soft for comfort. 

When did *I* know? *How* do I know? *Do* I know who I am? 

*There was not a surrounding conversation because I was just allowed to be present: present in action, without speculation.*

I read Travis because I'm going to be the plus one at [The Black Archives Book Club in July](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tbab-book-club-none-of-the-above-s04e07-tickets-791976652487?aff=oddtdtcreator). The team is better organized than most. There's even a Spotify playlist for the session. In it, I discover Lafemmebear's _Win_. How does something like *that* have less than 37,000 plays? Have all the woke people with good taste left Spotify by now? 

I bet Travis knows it perfectly, the barely describable thread of red holding them together. Evidently, so does Lafemmebear.

Friday is my favorite day of the year: I attend my very first Omek Summit. Seemingly effortlessly, Omek has become the community to which I most eagerly return. Oh, to inhabit spaces filled with people whose lived experiences are similar to mine. The theme this year: *the era of the bicultural*.

The day is sunny, Tolhuistuin vibrant and gorgeous. I spend the morning and afternoon placing myself in a tradition of Black humans finding their way in White professional spaces. I've heard it before, but this time it lands when Kemo says that we have a super power. _The era of the Bicultural_. But what, exactly, is bicultural about the child of a White mother that grew up in a decided lack of Blackness?

Monday is Ketikoti, and I dress accordingly in blue and white. I buy a unicorn that's clearly of African descent: brown fur, with a rainbow horn and two big afro poofs. I'm at once a child, and at once the mother of that child who _does_ know the sound of Black girl joy. I see half the attendee list of the Omek Summit there, which makes me feel proud. I see my new neighborhood friend.

On Wednesday, my new neighborhood friend and I meet for coffee. She's such a power house; a leader in doing the type of work that makes life better for people like us. A big thing is about to take place, and we discuss what it's going to mean for her and her team. I can tell she's frightened, but proud.

We're only new friends, but we've known each other for years, in passing. I ask her why I feel so much more connected to non-African Dutch people of color who were adopted than I do to African expats I encounter. She's everything but surprised. Both initially succumbed to a life lived in White spaces, we now are more capable of finding balance in our social and working lives between people who understand, and... _others_.

I've never been to São Tomé, the island of my father, that great place of unknown to me and it seems most of the people I meet. Whenever I encounter an African from a Lusophone country - which is to say a country that was once, like São Tomé, colonized by the Portuguese - there's a familiarity I can't quite pinpoint. As if they're running into an old school friend.

At the Omek Summit, after dinner, Sofia walked up to me with a man unfamiliar to me. *Gosh*, I thought, *he looks so much like my dad*. Sofia knows about me and my questions of belonging. *This is Leufigenio,* she said. *He's from São Tomé.* Like an old school friend, Leuf addressed me in enthusiastic Portuguese.
