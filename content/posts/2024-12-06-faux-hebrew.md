It has been 427 days since the [Israelâ€“Hamas war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war) broke out, 30 days since the [Maccabi Tel Aviv incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabi_Tel_Aviv_F.C.#cite_note-37), and my third time at the Holocaust Museumsince it opened in May. "No, I don't need the audio tour", I say at the desk. By now, I can dream it.

Even with something as atrocious as the Holocaust, repeated exposure to its visual remnants enables one to look beyond the boy next to the dead bodies, and to start paying attention to what isn't blatantly obvious. Today, I pause at the roll of fabric displaying yellow badges. Looking closer than usual, I realize the "o" in the Dutch word "Jood" ("Jew") very closely resembles the Hebrew letter "mem".

Later, I see the typeface again on antisemitic Nazi propaganda. Up until now, I have never given much thought to Nazi typography. I suppose, subconsciously, I ascribed the lettering to "old-fashioned script" or "German" typefaces. But of course, why wouldn't the design of the yellow badge be fully antisemitic, even beyond its shape?
