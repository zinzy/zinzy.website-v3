### Stuff I did

Anja's school year is coming to a close, which means I'm transitioning to working at the office full-time. After a few years of struggling, I now enjoy the seasonal changes to my working location.

On Monday, a bunch of us attended a big client meeting, which was fun, educational, and inspiring. With my new UX teammate [Maartje](https://maartjehulzinga.nl/) landing smoothly, I immediately have more time to spend on what really makes me tick at work: complex administrative and financial processes.

On Tuesday, I picked up Lemonade from her sleepover at Tante Annelie's. Walking her to the tram with a front pack and a back pack in 35-degree weather was a new kind of insanity, but here I am, writing this on a delightfully rainy Saturday. I'm not a complainer.

On Thursday, Gerimedica celebrated her 18th birthday with Indian food and a cocktail workshop. Social anxiety aside, it was fun to spend time with a small group of coworkers. I got to learn about the different genres of cocktails, and what makes a mocktail creatively different from emptying a bottle of soda onto a ball of ice and charging 15 euros.

Friday morning was for online meetings, the afternoon was different: a stroll in Flevopark with a new acquaintance. She told me at length about her estranged mother, mourning a living person who never really was, and finding her dead after a week and a half. It was astonishing to hear these words from a person in whom I could see myself.

### Consumed

I haven't been able to get over the harmonies in tUnE-yArDs' [Swarm](https://youtu.be/GoZ18fi4EjA?si=w67dk-RFkFGf9mPD), off their new album. After background-bingeing _Dance Moms_ and _Sister Wives_ for weeks, I've been making attempts to listen to music instead. 

To offset my penchant for bad reality TV, Anja and I have begun watching season 3 of _The Bear_. It is beautiful and strong; cosy with a hint of somber. I had missed that version of Jamie Lee Curtis.

I spent some time this week learning about the differences between routines and rhythms, and about what rhythm means in a year I've themed Intentionality. The better I become at looking after myself, the more accurately I can feel the rhythms of my body and the world around it. I looked for and found various ways to learn about the cyclical, the seasonal.

### Purchased
I surprised Anja with tickets to see tUnE-yArDs in Tolhuistuin (€55,32), and myself with the fact that they were even available. I realised recently that Anja, unlike most people I know, has a very rhythmic taste in music. We both happen to love this band precisely because of their command of the beat. I've been in cultural lockdown since Covid, forgetting effortlessly that bands are touring, plays are happening, films are scheduled. Together with these tickets, I now have three concerts planned for 2025.

### Appreciated
Anja and I are in a lovely phase of communication, openness, space-making, and space-taking. It makes me so much more appreciative of the human she is and the partnership she offers.

With regards to a personal matter, I find myself surrounded by people willing to offer an ear, a shoulder, and sage advice.

After two years of almost non-stop piano playing, I am gravitating back to the guitar. In recent months — as is always the case when feelings overflow — there has been a wealth of songwriting. Pairing that with an instrument that feels so familiar makes for lovely summertime leisure. 

### Wondered

What's the name of that German (Dutch?) designer who runs that design showcase website? How did the financial strategies of the _Sister Wives_ adults contribute to the disintegration of their family? Can a thing in which I find myself change nature depending on my vantage point? What _is_ Maddie Ziegler actually doing these days? Is it worth getting an annual Dipsea subscription? Should I reopen slots for my design mentoring? What are the grammatical limits of using "few and far between" in a sentence? What's the name of the backing vocalist in that tUnE-yArDs live performance? How's Bjork doing? How complex is it to be a glass-half-full kind of person if life only knows to smile at you?

### Something to improve
How can I lean into when my body tells me it's tired?
