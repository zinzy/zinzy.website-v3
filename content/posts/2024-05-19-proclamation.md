title: "Proclamation"
summary: "Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say _I follow Jesus_. Cringe."

"Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. — [Mark 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=NRSVA)

I said yes, but I had meant to say no.

On occasion, Anja and I joke that, if circumstances required, I could even strike up a friendship with a traffic light. I never understood the challenge of meeting new people if it wasn't at work or the gym. The vast majority of my friendships formed because I looked at someone across the room and thought, for whatever reason, _wow_.

Six days later, here we are.

"But, do you also believe that..." the woman asks, sounding slightly more alarmed than I think she wants to let on. No, I don't. "And what do you think about..." Many things, ma'am. I think many things about that. "But you could have found that sense of belonging with any other group, though, right?" The familiar caution when someone realizes I'm both who I say I am _as well as_ a Christian. The bemusement that engulfs us when a thing blurs that was clear but a second ago.

Whenever a person interviews me, because it always takes the form of an interview, about why I identify as a Christian despite, well, everything, I never quite know what to tell them. Whatever eloquence I ascribe to my person vanishes at the sound of all the words in the known universe failing to capture what it means when I say _I follow Jesus_. Cringe.

I don't think we're meant to put it into words, anyway. Still, millions of sermons, door-to-door pitches, books, podcasts, mission project plans, and — more recently — #ThatChristianGirl prayer routine videos will have us believe differently.

Yes, but actually no. What I find in Jesus is not what I would find in a sports team, a choir, or a book club. But what _do_ I find there, and how can I tell you about it if you ask without sounding like a nut case?

Ever since I met the woman for drinks, I've been thinking about how my pastor helped me through Mark 16:15 recently. I'm thankful I wasn't the only person at Bible study who shivered at the thought of standing by Central Station with a tower of Bible leaflets. That's what "proclaiming the good news" is, right?

I have so few proper examples of what Mark 16:15 looks like in the hands of a person such as myself, that I question their statistical validity. My faith proclamation has often taken the shape of a concession. The formula is simple:

Despite Christianity's hyperfocus on the virgin birth, the resurrection, Biblical literalism, and faith healings, I'm a Christian.

Despite Christianity's queerphobia, antisemitism, philosemitism, racism, abuse, mysogyny, misandry, and corruption, I'm a Christian.

Despite Christianity's judgement of what is harmless, and forgiveness of what is harmful, I'm a Christian.

Despite our global lack of Biblical literacy, I'm a Christian.

Despite ..., I'm a Christian.

Despite ...

Despite.
