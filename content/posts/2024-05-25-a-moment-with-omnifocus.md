I'm having a good moment with Omnifocus right now. I make a point to use fleeting terms when describing my relationship with the software. Over the course of the past fifteen years, I've jumped on and fallen off the Omnifocus bandwagon countless times, spending hundreds, thousands of euros in the process.

The trajectory is always the same: I start out lovingly dumping parts of my brain into its Inbox and organize everything neatly into projects. If this has been you, I know you've read at least 20 essays just like this one in the past half year alone. I'm sorry to be boring.

What I'll do below is visualize how I currently use Omnifocus. I'm doing so because I will probably need a reminder down the line, and because you may benefit from seeing a method that resonates with what you need from productivity software.
