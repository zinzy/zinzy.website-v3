_[The November edition of the IndieWeb Carnival](https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/) is about impact. Host [Xandra](https://xandra.cc/) invites us to reflect on, among other things, "what has made the biggest impact on your personality?"_

A golden retriever-like,  
glitter-in-your-face  
enthusiasm for life  
is one way  
I sometimes use  
to describe myself.  
  
I see it appear in the  
Get Well Soon card  
my coworkers put together.  
"I miss your smile!"  
"I miss my compliments!"  
I am but [one day out of my cast](/2024/11/27/12/51/14/).  
  
I cringe whenever I say  
anything about [darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/600331-ah-you-think-darkness-is-your-ally-you-merely-adopted).  
but, it's true and I feel it.  
Sometimes, the best thing to  
do to darkness is  
throw glitter in its face.  

Glitter, I've found,  
can ask myriad questions.  
"Is it okay that I'm here?"  
"Do you like me?"  
"Can I rest here?"  
"Am I safe?"  

"How are you feeling?"  
"Do you need a cheerleader?"  
"At last, I love life. You?"  
"Treat each other well,  
the rest is commentary,  
do you feel the same?"
