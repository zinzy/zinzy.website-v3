_[The November edition of the IndieWeb Carnival](https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/) is about impact. Host [Xandra](https://xandra.cc/) invites us to reflect "on the impact we leave on the world, and what kind of legacy we will leave in our absence"._

Whenever people ask me why I have such an American accent, I always tell them that Oprah was the only Black woman I knew growing up. It's funny, 'cause it's true.

_The Oprah Winfrey Show_ was such a 3 PM staple in our household that it's not a memory, but part of the fabric of my outlook on the world.
