A week ago, I found myself at The Black Archives / Bijlmer, a bright space full of books I had never read, and a storefront that would've made me come in even if I hadn't been invited. I was there as their Book Club's +1 to discuss [_None of the above : reflections on life beyond the binary_](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1394118432). Like [me](/about), it sits (un)comfortably at the intersection of being Black and non-binary. I read it with curiosity.

The Book Club gathering itself was excellent; I could write an entire story just about how amazing its facilitators are. More pressing, though, is what one of its attendees and my new acquaintance said.

> "Why does it matter what genre it is? That's just creating another box. Isn't the whole point of this that we should look beyond those?"

### What genre is _None of the Above_?
In preparation for the session, I read — not widely — about the author, Travis Alabanza. One aspect of prominence I encountered was their discussion of genre, and how they felt this definitely wasn't a memoir but rather a theoretical exercise:

"It feels like theory. It feels like someone like, you know, using their life to make it accessible to others, but then it feels like a theory book."[^1]

Now, I'm wont to engage in what some may call overthinking; for me it's [just thinking](/im-neurodivergent). That may come across as snooty, but I'm serious: when a young, queer, Black, smart writer and artist insists on describing their work in less low-culture terms than their publisher, I see a conversation.

Something about "it feels like theory" vexes me. It also returns me to the late 2010s, when two of my favorite productions travelled awards season.

### Mis-_genre_-ning media, a common mistake

Hannah Gadsby's _Nanette_ (2017) had been released on Netflix, and threw off the world by storm with its brilliant take on the exercise of making people laugh: Hannah understood it's a functional way to demonstrate the agents and effects of trauma. [It _was_ stand-up comedy, but the world argued furiously that it was not, because it was, for a change, _brilliant_ comedy](https://evergreenreview.com/read/your-laughter-is-my-trauma/).

Or a year before _Nanette_, when _Get Out_ was lauded for its ability to show us people of color a whole new reason to be terrified. "#GetOut will compete as a comedy at the 2018 Golden Globes" reported _Vulture_. [It _was not_ comedy, but the world — at least for a moment or to an extent — felt the horror of every-day racism was too much to bare](https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/jordan-peele-response-get-out-golden-globes-comedy-1201897841/).

> I consider each a masterpiece specifically _because_ of its ability to show not our inclination to circumscribe, but to gatekeep what we put in the box.

_Nanette_ as _not stand-up_ removes it as competition from what we've come to see as stand-up: usually white usually straight usually men standing on a stage telling silly jokes at the expense of everybody who is not them, especially marginalized communities. _Get Out_ as comedy neutralizes the threat it poses to white people, who involuntarily see themselves as perpetrators in the film's every-day racism. 

### Obviously, Travis, _None of the Above_ is not a memoir. Unless you want to use that term intentionally.
I'm surprised it was ever even a topic of discussion at your publisher's table. I suppose they thought "memoir" was just more bankable. I wanted to tell you memoirs can be at least one of two things. They can be the thing we write as people of old after a lifetime of great success. I imagine every _Golden Girl_ published a memoir at one point. 

> "Memoir" is what we never agreed to use for "this was not written by a writer".

A memoir can also be something entirely different. Have you read Carmen Maria Machado's perplexing _[
In the Dream House: A Memoir](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1129573917)_? If you haven't, go do it today. Machado doesn't use one chapter to map out each step of her hero's journey. Instead, she makes us witness to her attempt at reconciling with the female-on-female intimate partner violence she experienced.

Carmen knew how to reclaim a label. Her work could also be considered _much more_ than just a memoir.

### In "It feels like theory" hides a quiet tragedy of marginalization. 

In the margins, we have advanced degrees in living while other people get to tell us who we are, what we produce, and how we interpret the world. 

feeling. Theory is what we do when we deeply contextualize an inkling we have; when we
