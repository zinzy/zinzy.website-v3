I had the pleasure of being the +1 at [The Black Archives Bijlmer Book Club](https://www.theblackarchives.nl/tbabookclub.html), where we read Travis Alabanza's _None of the Above_. Meredith and Wally were excellent hosts, and I loved meeting new people with similar interests.

I had strong feelings about Alabanza's insistence that this work "feels like theory", in response to it being marketed as a memoir. Calling _Get Out_ a comedy diminishes the value of Black storytelling in horror narratives. But calling it a documentary is just as ineffective. "Feels like theory" very much sits in that spectrum, for me.

I enjoyed the lively conversation my strong feelings sparked about respectability and Black works, and was surprised the lyrical essay appears to be such an unknown genre when I offered it.
