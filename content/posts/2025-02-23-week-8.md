### Three wins

1. Walked on tip toes as soon as I formed the conviction that hiking boots reign supreme.
2. Spent the entire Tuesday with Anja at [Studio Pansa](http://studiopansa.com/), where I made my first two wheel-thrown pots. Looking back, the whole thing was too wet, which is confirmed by the ridiculous amount of clay I brought home on my clothes. Between drying, trimming, firing, glazing, and more firing, it could be months before I find out whether I did it right. I find that quite exhilirating.
3. This feels like a bit of a sad win, but I've cancelled my YouTube Premium account, putting an end to three months of near non-stop background videos, and bad reality TV on repeat. I've replaced it with discovering new music through [NTS Radio](https://www.nts.live/), which continues to delight me.

### Stuff I did

My manager and I worked on my professional goals, and I was pleased to hear he was impressed with my approach to the project. I'm excited for what 2025 has in store for us. Having taken a few days off, my work week didn't really start until Wednesday. I spent Thursday at the office, engaging in inspiring conversations with coworkers taking charge of their own destiny. It's bizarre to think that, a few weeks ago, I could barely make it through a workday without nap time. 

One thing I'm proud of is that I've developed a set of productivity habits that sustain me, and not drain me. I'm a notorious "planner hopper", moving between my Filofax, some digital Goodnotes planner, Obsidian, and Omnifocus on an almost monthly basis. Thanks to [Kirstin](https://kdigitalstudio.com/)'s brilliant flagship planner, I'm more intentional about what I'm committing myself to, and capable of dreaming about goals without overengineering them.

### Consumed

No more YouTube, great! Instead, NTS Radio is on in the background for periods of time, not as background noise, but as good old radio showcasing things I've never heard before. For those lofi focus mode beats, I've been turning to [lofi.cafe](https://www.lofi.cafe/). Well into season 6 of _Seinfeld_, I'm already dreading making it to the end of the show.

### Purchased
With our beautiful new bathroom come new furniture smells, and I don't seem to be the biggest fan of whatever branded perfume IKEA uses in its factories. I bought linen-scented laundry perfume and clothing sachets at Dille & Kamille for €29,40. Having tired my beloved pink fleece blankets, I bought two soft new ones and two for our friends who could use some coziness, €34,99 at JYSK.

### Appreciated
The quiet at Studio Pansa is very unlike the perpetual Amsterdam soundscape. What an absolute privilege to sit there in silence.

### Wondered

Where is Assisi? Is Sutton Foster white? What's that cool UX volunteering platform again? Did other people think _Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_ was a little antisemitic in the later seasons? How prominent are the company names on theater posters? How do I used the word "thrall"? Ben Werdmuller is Dutch?! Who is Jerry Seinfeld married to? 

### Something to improve
Physical therapy exercises, come _on_!
