For this month's edition of the IndieWeb Carnival, V.H. Belvadi invites us to muse on the importance of friction. As a designer, I think about friction every day, particularly in the context of user workflows and stakeholder opinions.

Here I am.

I have called it many names over the years. Ones that aluded to my love for stationery products, my interest in productivity frameworks, my partaking in the blogosphere, and my affinity with [systems thinking](/im-neurodivergent/). All of those things are true about me. Nevertheless, they don't paint the clearest picture, which is that I, like many others, procrastinate to the point of idiocracy using the exact instruments designed to combat it.

For the vast majority of the past decade, every few months or so, I land myself in the same funk. My ever-existing challenge to balance being service-oriented with working on what matters to me gets me to a point where I am taking on a large workload, both professionally and personally. It's usually a moment where I can put to good use one of my favorite skills: [being lazy](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job). With little time for fuss, I context-switch my way through the week, producing deliverable after deliverable, and biting chunks out of challenging projects.

This phase is usually marked by a frictionless act: resubscribing to OmniFocus. 

It's a dance I've danced so many times I'm embarrassed to even say it out loud.
