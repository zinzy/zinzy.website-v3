Overhauled my website UI today. I sometimes wonder if I'm making a mistake not keeping a changelog, but at the rate I'm going, it wouldn't make much sense. Either way, settling on a paginated diary-style means I'm officially saying goodbye to my commitment to keeping this page under 250kb. I wouldn't be surprised if, one of these days, I get another sweet email from Norman KÃ¶hring reminding me of this fact.
