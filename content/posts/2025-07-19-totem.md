_I wrote this as part of this monthâ€™s [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival), which is hosted by [Maxwell Joslyn](https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2025/07/01/1) and focuses on [totems](https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2025/07/01/1). The one consistent totem I carry through life, which says most about me, how I view the world and to what group I feel I belong, is my diary._

In all of its formats, mediums, consistencies, and varities, the diary has been a vehicle for introspection for most of my life.
