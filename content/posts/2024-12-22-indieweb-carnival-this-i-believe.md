_This month's host of the IndieWeb Carnival is [me](/), and I chose the theme [belief](/2024/11/28/indieweb-carnival-december-2024-belief/). I'm using the theme to write about something I believe firmly. Here I am._

From the moment I triple-fractured my ankle [on a Friday evening in late October](/2024/10/26/11/24/10/) it was clear to me what the story was: God says "sit down" repeatedly, Zinzy finally obliges. This I believe firmly: when I seek to uncover the lesson I can learn from a bad situation, the entire thing becomes a lot more acceptable to stomach.

For a while since the accident, I felt quite strong and powerful. I was back at work the Monday after, rolling around the house the wheelchair for which I had arranged. I felt like I sailed through two weeks of pre-surgery, and even found a way to enjoy the extra week I needed for my ankle to stop swelling. I was in bed on Google Meet the day after surgery, not feeling in any way that I was pushing it.

Granted, that second week after surgery wasn't fun. The prospect of five weeks of life on one foot would turn into six or seven made me mildly depressed. I don't know if you've ever done a pistol squat on the toilet, but it really stops being fun after a few days. Luckily, as scheduled, I was able to transition to a removable aircast, which I'm able to take off whenever I needed to. Throughout all of this, despite all the uncertainty, I felt like I had a pretty good handle on the situation.




"Don't progress too slowly. Your body will tell you when you've overdone it."

I did overdo it, apparently, both the amount of walking and the nonchalant wound care. 


There's a song I love featured on Patty Griffin's spectacular album _[Impossible Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Dream_(Patty_Griffin_album))_ that's stuck in my head today: ["When It Don't Come Easy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXuPyE7CKZQ). In recovering from a late-October triple ankle fracture, I'm supposed to graduate from an aircast to a normal shoe on Christmas Day. Instead, I'm measuring my temperature every two hours to ensure the surgical wound infection doesn't transition into the danger zone.

Throughout this entire process, I was stunned to see how positive my disposition remained, even as two weeks pre surgery turned into three weeks.
