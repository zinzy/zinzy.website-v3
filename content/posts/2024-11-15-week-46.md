- After the swelling in my ankle postponing it with a week, I was finally able to have surgery on my left ankle on Wednesday!
- I'm surprised by how pleasant the whole experience was. Post-surgery, I'm in very little pain, and aside from two low-dose painkillers I feel like I'm raw-dogging recovery. 
- I had been nervous about having to take opioids to mitigate pain, but luckily I haven't needed them. 
- I'm trying my hardest to keep my foot up so that the post-surgery swelling can go down. If I'm lucky, I just might make it to Paris after all.
- In this interstitial state between lying in the road with a triple fracture and running, I find myself learning all sorts of sweet things. Like how excellent Anja and I collaborate in a crisis. How cozy it feels to write in my journal with my head under the covers so as not to wake Anja. 
- It seems everyone's getting covid again. I was so bummed and embarrassed to miss our annual corporate event, only to learn that it was a complete super spreader, _again_.
