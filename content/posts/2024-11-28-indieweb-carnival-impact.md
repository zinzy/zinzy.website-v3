_[The November edition of the IndieWeb Carnival](https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/) is about impact. Host [Xandra](https://xandra.cc/) invites us to reflect on, among other things, "what has made the biggest impact on your personality?"_

All things considered, there are many positive aspects to [breaking my ankle](/2024/10/26/11/24/10/) and needing over a month to return to [putting my left foot on the ground again](/2024/11/27/12/51/14/). One of them is my manager Salva, a total mensch, driving to my house to give me treats and sweet card with messages from my coworkers. Another one is seeing that many of the messages say something very specific about what people miss when I'm absent for a month.

"I miss your bright and charming smile. Get well soon!" one of them reads.

It's not the first time I see somebody refer to my cheerfulness or sunny face. And that's not a humble brag, either. My golden retriever-like glitter-in-your-face enthusiasm for life and everyone in it is perhaps what best describes my personality.

But it didn't come from a happy place.

If you've been here before, you may have seen me use terms like "early childhood trauma", "complex trauma" or "adverse childhood experiences". They all gravitate around the same truth: that I left home after 19 years that contributed in no way to me being able to take proper care of myself.
