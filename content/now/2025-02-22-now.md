### Things almost seem normal again

Every now and then, when the moment is just right, I forget that I can't really _walk_ just yet. Like the morning of this photo, when I did my home-famous ballet jump, only to land on my left foot in a way that made me regret everything. It was the morning of my birthday gift to Anja: a taster class at [Studio Pansa](https://www.studiopansa.com/), where she hadn't been since her head injury. About three months ago, [I triple-fractured my ankle](/tags/broken-ankle/). What came after was a transformation, both of the body and of the mind.

### At work,

There's much to discover. We're full steam ahead, and there are plenty of unknowns to investigate, which means I've got my hands in the clay of delicious exploratory research. I'm impressed with how capable we all are of committing to continuous research. Meanwhile, Gerimedica is growing, and it's great to welcome new faces.

### Health-wise,

I'm delighted by my progress. When I was on the ground behind the Royal Palace, tired head resting on the cobblestones, getting acquainted with the sensation of fracture, one thought hovered in my head: I'll wake up in April thinking "oh wow, I can barely remember what that felt like." Nothing could be further from the truth. Every day, I have at least half a dozen déjà vus.

Remember when bathroom visits were pistol squats? Remember when you couldn't walk into the patio at home? Remember when you couldn't walk to the tram stop? Remember when you couldn't walk and hold anything but crutches? Remember how your left leg was elevated two feet at bedtime, 7 weeks in a row? Physical therapy thrice weekly is doing wonders.

### At home,

We're taking on DIY projects again. Now that I'm better able to help out around the house, Anja gets a much-needed break from it all. Also: home improvement! We recently began remodeling our bathroom, and boy, does it look sexy. I feel like I live in a Swedish hotel.

### Community-wise,

All Saints continues to grow. While we're still a small bunch, familiar faces keep returning to join a church service, to attend morning or evening prayer. Recently, we hosted a Bible study at the most progressive queer bar in town. Shouting thoughtfulness across the table over loud music, and sitting with our eyes closed praying for each other felt so powerful. I love the community we're perpetually becoming.

### What I'm looking forward to

I'm impatient to get back to "normal", foot-wise, because I have things to do! We're hoping to make it to Paris in late April, and in the meantime, my excitement for pottery continues to simmer. I'm looking to enroll in an eight-week ceramics course to better understand the process, and to get that coveted status of being eligible to become a studio member at Pansa.
