- **Working on** DesignOps, ResearchOps, and employee experience design at Gerimedica as a principal designer

- **Living** at a faster day-to-day pace after after recovering rather successfully from a [broken ankle](/tags/broken-ankle/)

- **Spending time** writing songs, publishing [slices of life](/), reading a few classics, writing essays, [practicising being a good human](/praxis)

- **Creating room for** rhythm over routine, gentleness over force, tendencies over discipline

- **Learning to trust** that, when it comes to cultural kinship, I identify most with people of any ethnicity adopted by Dutch couples than I sometimes to with African people. They, too, grew up in a twilight zone of heritage: definitely not white, but also not considered anything else.

- **Looking forward to** my first time attending the Amsterdam Pride Canal Parade

- **Revisiting** Apostle Paul and how many negative feelings I have about him. Feeling that, in truth, seem largely based on nothing of substance.

- **Teaching** our new junior designer [Maartje](https://maartjehulzinga.nl/) the ropes of agile business-to-business product development. She's catching on _quickly_.

- **Challenged by** the clash between my desire to be present and my propensity for dissociation

- **Saying yes to** my need for quiet time
