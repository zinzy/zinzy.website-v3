Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. I'm looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in You've Got Mail, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. I'm also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.

What I'm enjoying spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app, as well as CelinaSpookyBoo's dad jokes and her accompanying laugh. I've been reading about chronic shame. I've been playing around with Gatsby starters for a bit, and I'm ready to begin building things from scratch.
