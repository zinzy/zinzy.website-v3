prenotes: "I have a bit of a thing for Matt Damon. That's why it's odd that it took me so long to watch this film. It unfolded for me as a good episode of _Black Mirror_: nifty technology slowly but surely causes more problems than solutions. The second part was okay, and made me think of _Midsommar_."
