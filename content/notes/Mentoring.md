Because I love winning friends and influencing people[^1], I reserve a small portion of my time for mentoring UX professionals and hopefuls and other people in the product field. You're welcome to book a free 30-minute session with me through [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).

While each person's story is unique, it's easy to see commonalities in the struggles of the average UX career. These are things I am asked often in my role as a mentor:
### How do I actually organize a research project?
Research is all about moving from assumptions and unknowingness to a state of knowing just enough to unblock a project. When you begin planning your research, don't start with the method. Instead, start with the questions you need an answer to. Are they the right questions? What type of data should you collect to answer them? To get started on this journey, which happens to be my favorite, read UserInterviews.com's [Field Guide](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide).
